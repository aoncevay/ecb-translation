It is imperative that Member States , the European Commission and the Council of the European Union implement the revised framework in a rigorous and consistent manner conducive to prudent fiscal policies .
More than ever , in the present circumstances , it is essential that all parties concerned fulfil their respective responsibilities .
The fiscal framework enshrined in the Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of EMU and thus key to anchoring expectations of fiscal discipline .

Recommendation of the ECB of 1 February 2006 to the Council of the European Union on the external auditors of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank ( ECB / 2006/1 )
The current rates remain appropriate .
The monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained , as suggested by weak money and credit growth .
Overall , the Governing Council expects price stability to be maintained over the medium term , thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households .
Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence .
Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term .
This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth , job creation and financial stability .
Accordingly , the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely .
Turning to the economic analysis , euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009 , after a period of sharp decline .
The ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports , together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system , should provide support to the euro area economy .
Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture .
Upside risks over the medium term relate , in particular , to the evolution of commodity prices .
Furthermore , increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected , owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years .
At the same time , risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained .
Together , these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained .
However , further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up .
To sum up , the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained , as suggested by weak money and credit growth .
For all euro area countries , structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery .
Likewise , measures that increase price flexibility and non-price competitiveness are essential .
Finally , an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role .
Sound balance sheets , effective risk management and transparent , robust business models are key to strengthening banks » resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance , thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth , job creation and financial stability .

Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , and in particular Article 27.1 thereof , Whereas : ( 1 )
Pursuant to Article 37 ( 1 ) of the Federal Act on the Oesterreichische Nationalbank , the General Meeting of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank ( OeNB ) must elect two auditors and two alternate auditors each year .
The alternate auditors may be mandated only in the event that the auditors are not able to perform the audit .
On 14 March 2006 the Council of the European Union , having regard to Recommendation ECB / 2006/1 of 1 February 2006 to the Council of the European Union on the external auditors of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank ( 1 ) , approved KPMG Alpen-Treuhand GmbH and TPA Horwath Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH as joint external auditors , and Moore Stephens Austria Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft mbH and BDO Auxilia Treuhand GmbH as joint alternate auditors for the financial year 2006 ( 2 ) .
To appoint the necessary second alternate auditor , the OeNB conducted a restricted procurement procedure , selected Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungs GmbH and invited the ECB to recommend it to the EU Council for approval .
The approval of the EU Council is necessary to appoint Moore Stephens Austria Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft mbH as the second external auditor and Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungs GmbH as the second alternate external auditor of the OeNB .
It is recommended that TPA Horwath Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH and Moore Stephens Austria Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft mbH should be appointed jointly as the external auditors of the OeNB for the financial year 2006 .
It is recommended that BDO Auxilia Treuhand GmbH and Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungs GmbH should be appointed jointly as the alternate external auditors of the OeNB for the financial year 2006 .
This mandate may be renewed on a yearly basis , not exceeding a total term of five years , ending with the financial year 2010 at the latest .
The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply .
Euro foreign exchange reference rates Daily nominal effective exchange rate Fixed euro conversion rates
It is therefore necessary to appoint external auditors from the financial year 2008 .

On 8 July 2008 the Council of the European Union approved Slovakia 's application to join the euro area on 1 January 2009 .
The pre-distribution (" frontloading ") of euro cash to professional third parties prior to 1 January 2009 helped to ensure a smooth cash changeover , alleviate the logistical burden and reduce the costs of having two currencies circulating at the same time .
The frontloading of coins to banks started in September 2008 , and the frontloading of banknotes one month later .
Some of this cash was passed on to retailers and other companies (" sub-frontloading ") .
The frontloading of euro banknotes and coins was governed by Guideline ECB / 2006/9 as amended by Guideline ECB / 2008/4 .
An unofficial consolidated text has been produced by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities .
From 17 January 2009 only euro banknotes and coins can be used for cash payments in Slovakia , but banks will continue to exchange Slovak koruna banknotes until the end of 2009 and Slovak koruna coins until the end of June 2009 , at the fixed conversion rate .
Fees may be charged by banks as of 20 January 2009 if the amount per customer and transaction exceeds 100 banknotes and 100 coins .

Decision of the ECB of 18 December 2003 amending Article 1 ( f ) of Decision ECB / 2001/16 of 6 December 2001 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of participating Member States from the financial year 2002 ( ECB / 2003/22 )
Decision of the ECB of 22 November 2007 amending Decision ECB / 2001/16 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of participating Member States from the financial year 2002 ( ECB / 2007/15 )
In accordance with the first sentence of Article 17.5 of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB , the Governing Council has adopted this opinion .
The accounts of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and of the national central banks of the Eurosystem are audited by independent external auditors recommended by the Governing Council of the ECB and approved by the Council of the European Union .
It is therefore necessary to appoint external auditors from the financial year 2006 .
The main purpose of this assessment is to help central banks in the accession countries to identify those parts of their securities settlement arrangements that will still need to be addressed in order to facilitate the smooth functioning of Eurosystem credit operations .
A formal assessment of the eligibility of the respective securities settlement systems for Eurosystem credit operations will be carried out as soon as these systems hold collateral eligible for Eurosystem credit operations .
The assessment has revealed that the securities infrastructure in many accession countries may already be deemed relatively adequate .
In most countries , the securities clearing and settlement infrastructure has largely been developed over the past decade .
Within this time frame , some accession countries have not sufficiently developed their securities infrastructure owing to a lack of resources as well as the low volume of securities traffic , which has hampered the recovery of initial investment costs .
[ 2 ] In Cyprus , the government securities used for central bank credit operations are being dematerialised and the registers transferred from the Central Bank of Cyprus to the Central Depository and Central Registry ( CDCR ) .
By focusing the monetary policy of the ECB on this objective , the Treaty incorporates modern economic thinking about the role , scope and limits of monetary policy and underlies the institutional and organisational set-up of central banking in Economic and Monetary Union .
The objective of maintaining price stability has been assigned by the Treaty for good reasons .
The Eurosystem is required to act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition , favouring an efficient allocation of resources .
At today 's meeting , which was held in Brussels , the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions :
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 75 basis points to 2.50% , starting from the operation to be settled on 10 December 2008 .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be decreased by 75 basis points to 3.00% , with effect from 10 December 2008 .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be decreased by 75 basis points to 2.00% , with effect from 10 December 2008 .

Chapter 3 describes open market operations , while Chapter 4 presents the standing facilities available to counterparties .
Chapter 7 presents the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system .
The ESCB is governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB .
The Eurosystem may also use outright transactions , the issuance of debt certificates , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits .
All counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria specified in Section 2.1 may participate in standard tenders .
The Eurosystem may select a limited number of counterparties to participate in quick tenders .
Without prejudice to the primary objective of price stability , the Eurosystem has to support the general economic policies in the European Community .
In pursuing its objectives , the Eurosystem has to act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition , favouring an efficient allocation of resources .
In these operations , the Eurosystem does not , as a rule , intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker .
The instruments and procedures applied in the conduct of fine-tuning operations are adapted to the types of transactions and the specific objectives pursued in the operations .
Structural operations in the form of reverse transactions and the issuance of debt instruments are carried out by the national central banks through standard tenders .
Under normal circumstances , there are no credit limits or other restrictions on counterparties » access to the facility apart from the requirement to present sufficient underlying assets .
The reserve requirement of each institution is determined in relation to elements of its balance sheet .
Institutions » holdings of required reserves are remunerated at the rate of the Eurosystem 's main refinancing operations .
For foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes , counterparties must be able to conduct large-volume foreign exchange operations efficiently under all market conditions .
The range of counterparties to foreign exchange swaps corresponds to the counterparties located in the euro area which are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations .
These general eligibility criteria are uniform throughout the euro area .
For outright transactions , no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties .
In this respect , activity in the money market is the prime selection criterion .
In quick tenders and bilateral operations , the national central banks deal exclusively with the counterparties which are included in their respective set of fine-tuning counterparties .
If the ECB were to carry out bilateral operations , the selection of counterparties would in such cases be made by the ECB according to a rotation scheme among those counterparties in the euro area which are eligible for quick tenders and bilateral operations in order to ensure equitable access .
Further provisions for reverse transactions based on repurchase agreements are specified in the contractual arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or the ECB ) .
As for the instruments used , reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed in all four categories of operations , whereas debt certificates may be used for structural absorption operations .
In the following sections , specific features of the different types of open market instruments used by the Eurosystem are presented in detail .
In addition , the Eurosystem can use reverse transactions for structural and fine-tuning operations .
The interest rate on a reverse transaction in the form of a collateralised loan is determined by applying the specified interest rate on the credit amount over the maturity of the operation .
They also provide the bulk of refinancing to the financial sector .
The ECB does not impose any restrictions on the transferability of the certificates .
In each foreign exchange swap operation , the Eurosystem and the counterparties agree on the swap points for the transaction .
The swap points are the difference between the exchange rate of the forward transaction and the exchange rate of the spot transaction .
The swap points of the euro vis-à-vis the foreign currency are quoted according to general market conventions .
The collection of fixed-term deposits is envisaged only for fine-tuning purposes in order to absorb liquidity in the market .
No collateral is given by the national central banks in exchange for the deposits .
The procedures for end-of-day access to the marginal lending facility are specified in Section 5.3.3 .
A counterparty may also be granted access to the marginal lending facility by sending a request to the national central bank in the Member State in which the counterparty is established .
The facility is intended to satisfy counterparties » temporary liquidity needs .
Under normal circumstances , the interest rate on the facility provides a ceiling for the overnight market interest rate .
For counterparties participating directly in TARGET , the credit is repaid on the next day on which the relevant national RTGS system and the relevant SSS ( s ) are operational , at the time at which those systems open .
Access to the deposit facility is granted through the national central bank in the Member State in which the institution is established .
Access to the deposit facility is granted only on days when the relevant national RTGS system is open .
To be granted access to the deposit facility , the counterparty must send a request to the national central bank in the Member State in which the counterparty is established .
The national central banks will provide information on any such deviations from the access conditions described in this document .
The ECB may adapt the conditions of the facility or suspend it at any time .
Counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria specified in Section 2.1 may participate in standard tenders .
The Eurosystem distinguishes between two different types of tender procedures : standard tenders and quick tenders .
Quick tenders are only used for the execution of fine-tuning operations .
The normal trade days for the main and the longer-term refinancing operations are specified in Table 2 .
The ECB aims to ensure that counterparties in all Member States can participate in the main and the longer-term refinancing operations .
The announcement of quick tenders follows the same procedures as those for standard tenders .
The minimum bid amount is applied to each individual interest rate level .
The ECB may impose a maximum bid limit in order to prevent disproportionately large bids .
Any such maximum bid limit is always specified in the public tender announcement message .
Bids are revocable up to the tender submission deadline .
Bids submitted after the deadline specified in the tender announcement message are invalid .
Respect of the deadline is judged by the national central banks .
The national central banks discard all the bids of a counterparty if the aggregate amount bid exceeds any maximum bid limit established by the ECB .
The national central banks also discard any bid which is below the minimum bid amount or which is below any minimum or above any maximum accepted interest rate / price / swap point .
Furthermore , the national central banks may discard bids which are incomplete or which do not follow the pro forma example .
If a bid is discarded , the respective national central bank informs the counterparty about its decision prior to the tender allotment .
The amount allotted to each counterparty is rounded to the nearest euro .
However , the ECB may decide to allot a minimum amount / ratio to each bidder in fixed rate tenders .
The ECB may decide to allot a minimum amount to each successful bidder in variable rate tenders .
If , at the lowest swap point quotation accepted ( i.e. the marginal swap point quotation ) , the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted , the remaining amount is allocated pro rata among the bids according to the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation ( see Box 6 ) .
In addition , national central banks may announce the allotment result directly to counterparties without access to wire services .
According to the precise instructions given by the ECB , the national central banks decide whether to enter into a deal with the counterparties .
The transactions are settled through the national central banks .
If the Governing Council of the ECB were to decide that , under exceptional circumstances , bilateral operations could also be executed by the ECB itself ( or by one or a few national central banks acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) , the procedures for such operations would be adapted accordingly .
In this case , the ECB ( or the national central bank ( s ) acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) would directly contact one or a few counterparties in the euro area , selected according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 .
The ECB ( or the national central bank ( s ) acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) would decide whether to enter into a deal with the counterparties .
The transactions would nevertheless be settled in a decentralised manner through the national central banks .
In addition , the ECB may decide not to announce the results of bilateral operations publicly .
Only national central banks of Member States where the trade day , the settlement day and the reimbursement day are NCB business days participate in such operations .
Money transactions are settled only after ( or at the moment of ) the final transfer of the assets underlying the operation .
The settlement dates for the main and the longer-term refinancing operations are specified in advance in the Eurosystem 's tender operations calendar ( see Section 5.1.2 ) .
The specific eligibility criteria for tier two applied by the respective national central banks are subject to approval by the ECB .
For underlying assets used in liquidity-absorbing reverse open market operations , the eligibility criteria are identical to those applied for underlying assets used in liquidity-providing reverse open market operations .
The risk control measures at the disposal of the Eurosystem are described in Box 7 .
This implies that the value of the underlying asset is calculated as the market value of the asset less a certain percentage ( haircut ) .
This implies that if the value , measured on a regular basis , of the underlying assets falls below a certain level , the national central bank will require the counterparty to supply additional assets or cash ( i.e. a margin call ) .
If the income flow is transferred to the counterparty , national central banks ensure that the relevant operations will still be fully covered by a sufficient amount of underlying assets before the transfer of the income takes place .
Once the home central bank has been informed by the correspondent central bank that the collateral has been received , it transfers the funds to the counterparty .
Central banks do not advance funds until they are certain that the counterparties » securities have been received by the correspondent central bank .
Assets deposited with a correspondent central bank can only be used to collateralise Eurosystem credit operations .
The amount of minimum reserves to be held by each institution is determined in relation to its reserve base .
This implies that branches in the euro area of entities with no registered office in the euro area are also subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system .
Liabilities vis-à-vis other institutions included in the list of institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system and liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB and the national central banks are not included in the reserve base .
The ECB establishes and maintains a list of institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system .
An institution may apply to the national central bank in the Member State in which the institution is resident for permission to hold all its minimum reserves indirectly through an intermediary .
Reserve holdings exceeding the required reserves are not remunerated .
The remuneration is paid on the second NCB business day following the end of the maintenance period over which the remuneration was earned .
The maturity of the deposit may not exceed the period during which the institution failed to comply with the reserve requirement .
The ECB decides to allot a total of EUR 105 million .
Assets included in the pool of assets used by the counterparty are not earmarked for specific transactions .
The risk control framework in the pooling system is described in Table 3 .
EEA ( European Economic Area ) countries : the EU Member States and Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway .
End-of-day : the time of the business day ( after the TARGET system has closed ) at which the payments processed in the TARGET system are finalised for the day .
Fine-tuning operation : a non-regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem mainly in order to deal with unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market .
Haircut : see valuation haircut .
Repurchase price : the price at which the buyer is obliged to sell back assets to the seller in relation to a transaction under a repurchase agreement .
A first efficiency criterion relates to competitive pricing behaviour and the counterparty 's ability to handle large volumes , even in turbulent market conditions .
In specific cases , the ECB may rely on statistical information collected for such purposes to fulfil its requirements .
The benefit of the lump-sum allowance remains , however , for the group as a whole .
Moreover , the relevant NCB may authorise the acquiring institution to fulfil its obligation to report statistical information through temporary procedures .
This derogation from normal reporting procedures must be limited to the minimum time possible and , in any case , should not exceed six months after the merger has taken effect .
In Chapter 2 , eligibility criteria for counterparties taking part in Eurosystem monetary policy operations are specified .
For standard tenders , a maximum of 24 hours elapses between the tender announcement and the certification of the allotment result .
Fine-tuning operations are primarily executed as reverse transactions , but can also take the form of outright transactions , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits .
Fine-tuning operations are normally executed by the national central banks through quick tenders or bilateral procedures .
These operations are executed whenever the ECB wishes to adjust the structural position of the Eurosystem vis-à-vis the financial sector ( on a regular or non-regular basis ) .
Structural operations in the form of outright transactions are executed through bilateral procedures .
Institutions subject to minimum reserve requirements according to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB may access the standing facilities and participate in open market operations based on standard tenders .
The Eurosystem may select a limited number of counterparties to participate in fine-tuning operations .
An institution may access the Eurosystem 's standing facilities and open market operations based on standard tenders only through the national central bank of the Member State in which it is established .
Accordingly , longer-term refinancing operations are usually executed in the form of variable rate tenders and , from time to time , the ECB indicates the operation volume to be allotted in forthcoming tenders .
The calculation of the issue amount is shown in Box 1 .
Further provisions for foreign exchange swaps are specified in the contractual arrangement applied by the respective national central bank ( or the ECB ) .
Access to the marginal lending facility is granted through the national central bank in the Member State in which the institution is established .
Apart from the requirement to present sufficient underlying eligible assets , there is no limit to the amount of funds that can be advanced under the marginal lending facility .
If the aggregate amount bid exceeds the total amount of liquidity to be allotted , the submitted bids will be satisfied pro rata , according to the ratio of the amount to be allotted to the aggregate amount bid ( see Box 4 ) .
If , for the maturity of the swap , the foreign currency interest rate is higher than the corresponding interest rate for the euro , the swap point quotation is positive ( i.e. the euro is quoted at a premium to the foreign currency ) .
For these operations , the range of counterparties is not restricted a priori and the procedures are adapted to the market conventions for the debt instruments transacted .
They are defined in a broad sense as any procedures where the Eurosystem conducts a transaction with one or a few counterparties without a tender .
In this respect , two different types of bilateral procedures can be distinguished : operations where counterparties are contacted directly by the Eurosystem , and operations executed through stock exchanges and market agents .
Outright bilateral operations for structural purposes are normally only conducted and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States .
Further provisions related to the settlement procedures are defined in the contractual arrangements applied by the national central banks ( or the ECB ) for the specific monetary policy instruments .
The settlement procedures may differ slightly between national central banks owing to differences in national law and operational practices .
The coupon may be linked to a change in the rating of the issuer itself .
These features must be maintained until the redemption of the obligation .
In case such a rejection is based on prudential information , the use of any such information transmitted either by counterparties or by supervisors shall be strictly commensurate with , and necessary for , the performance of the Eurosystem 's tasks of conducting monetary policy .
This would imply that counterparties would need to provide underlying assets with a value at least equal to the liquidity provided by the Eurosystem plus the value of the initial margin .
Marketable assets issued by other agencies are included in liquidity category III .
The valuation haircut applied to such an instrument is set equal to the highest of the haircuts applicable to debt instruments with the same residual maturity , and coupon payments of any one of the types occurring in the remaining life of the instrument are considered .
In exceptional circumstances or when required for monetary policy purposes , the ECB may decide to extend the closing time of the CCBM until the closing time of TARGET .
Institutions » holdings of required reserves are remunerated at the rate on the Eurosystem 's main refinancing operations .
However , branches located outside the euro area of credit institutions established in the euro area are not subject to this system .
The selection policy does not entail a substantial departure from existing market standards , as it has been derived from the harmonisation of the national central banks » current best practices .
A first prudential criterion is creditworthiness , which is assessed using a combination of different methods ( e.g. using credit ratings available from commercial agencies and the in-house analysis of capital and other business ratios ) ;
For foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes , the range of counterparties corresponds to the counterparties located in the euro area which are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations .
Credit institutions in the tail have to report , as a minimum , quarterly data necessary to calculate the reserve base in accordance with Table 1a .
These institutions ensure that the reporting according to Table 1a is fully consistent with the definitions and classifications applicable in Table 1 .
At today 's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 4.25% , 5.25% and 3.25% respectively .
No longer in force : Decision of the ECB of 15 December 2006 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the ECB 's capital by the participating national central banks ( ECB / 2006/22 )
On 16 December 2004 , the Governing Council of the ECB approved the building of a Single Shared Platform ( SSP ) for TARGET2 on the basis of the joint offer made by the Banca d' Italia , Banque de France and Deutsche Bundesbank .
Framework for the detection of counterfeits and fitness sorting by credit institutions and other professional cash handlers
Pursuant to Article 23 in conjunction with Article 43.4 of the Statute , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks of the Member States that have adopted the euro ( hereinafter the « participating NCBs ') may establish relations with central banks in other countries and , where appropriate , with international organisations , and conduct all types of banking transactions in their relations with third countries and international organisations .
To this end , the Governing Council considers it necessary to adopt this Guideline to ensure , inter alia , that Eurosystem reserve management services are provided on a standardised basis under harmonised terms and conditions , that the ECB receives adequate information regarding these services , and that minimum common features required in contractual arrangements with customers are identified .
The authorised ECB personnel shall promptly inform the other Eurosystem members thereof .
Any such measure or decision shall not prevent the other Eurosystem members from providing Eurosystem reserve management services to such customers .
Any Eurosystem member that becomes an ESP or that terminates its status as an ESP shall inform the ECB thereof .

The heraldic lion in a variety of designs has been used on several Finnish coins over the years , for example on the 1 markka coins between 1964 and 2001 .
In this respect , the Governing Council of the ECB is responsible for the formulation of monetary policy , while the Executive Board is empowered to implement monetary policy according to the decisions made and guidelines laid down by the Governing Council .
Under normal circumstances , there are no deposit limits or other restrictions on counterparties » access to the facility .
The interest rate on the deposit facility normally provides a floor for the overnight market interest rate .
The standing facilities are administered in a decentralised manner by the national central banks .
The Eurosystem accepts a wide range of assets to underlie its operations .
This relates to cases of infringement of tender rules ( if a counterparty is unable to transfer a sufficient amount of underlying assets to settle the amount of liquidity it has been allotted in a liquidity-providing operation or if it is unable to deliver a sufficient amount of cash to settle the amount it has been allotted in a liquidity-absorbing operation ) , and of bilateral transaction rules ( if a counterparty is unable to deliver a sufficient amount of eligible underlying assets or if it is unable to deliver a sufficient amount of cash to settle the amount agreed in bilateral transactions ) .
In addition , the Eurosystem has three other instruments available for the conduct of fine-tuning operations : outright transactions , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits .
Fine-tuning operations aim to manage the liquidity situation in the market and to steer interest rates , in particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market .
Such operations are executed only for structural and fine-tuning purposes .
The transactions are executed in accordance with the market conventions for the debt instrument used in the transaction .
Further provisions related to ECB debt certificates will be contained in the terms and conditions for such certificates .
Access to the marginal lending facility is granted only on days when the relevant national real-time gross settlement ( RTGS ) system and the relevant SSS ( s ) are operational .
In such cases , the relevant national central bank is responsible for informing the counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be made for access to the marginal lending facility in relation to the bank holiday .
Under normal circumstances , the interest rate on the facility provides a floor for the overnight market interest rate .
In such cases , the relevant national central bank is responsible for informing the counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be made for access to the deposit facility in relation to the bank holiday .
For counterparties participating directly in TARGET , deposits held under the facility mature on the next day on which the relevant national RTGS system is operational , at the time at which this system opens .
The ECB may decide to conduct fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day .
With a view to enhancing transparency in its fine-tuning operations , the Eurosystem normally announces quick tenders publicly in advance .
However , under exceptional circumstances , the ECB may decide not to announce quick tenders publicly in advance .
Furthermore , inflation-indexed bonds are eligible .
Institutions » settlement accounts with the national central banks may be used as reserve accounts .
Reserve holdings on settlement accounts may be used for intraday settlement purposes .
The daily reserve holding of an institution is calculated as the end-of-day balance on its reserve account .
The holding of reserves through an intermediary does not change the statistical reporting obligations of institutions holding reserves via an intermediary .
Open market operation : an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in the financial market .
With regard to their aims , regularity and procedures , Eurosystem open market operations can be divided into four categories : main refinancing operations , longer-term refinancing operations , fine-tuning operations and structural operations .
Single rate auction ( Dutch auction ) : an auction in which the allotment interest rate ( or price / swap point ) applied for all satisfied bids is equal to the marginal interest rate .
Pursuant to Article 37 ( 1 ) of the Federal Act on the Oesterreichische Nationalbank , the General Meeting of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank ( OeNB ) shall elect two auditors and two alternate auditors each year .

The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead .
The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention .
Against this background , it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability .
In this context , the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices .
Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral , which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned .
The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided .
The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons .
Not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets , the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons .
As regards structural reforms , the Governing Council reiterates its full support for all efforts to enhance competition , increase productivity and foster market flexibility .
This issue of the Monthly Bulletin contains three articles .

2 January 2007 - Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union
On 1 January 2007 the European Union ( EU ) was enlarged through the accession of two new Member States , namely Bulgaria and Romania .
As from this date , the national central banks ( NCBs ) of the new Member States are integrated into the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) , and their respective Governors become members of the General Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) .
In addition , experts from these NCBs in the ESCB Committees have member status whenever the committees meet in ESCB composition .
Both the ECB and the European Commission will prepare convergence reports every two years , or at the request of a « Member State with a derogation » .
On 8 October 2007 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) presented the outcome of the detailed planning phase for its new premises .
The overall concept for the interior , including the materials and surfaces , was defined , and various installations were built in order to test both the functionality and quality of the materials chosen .
The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010 .
The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term .
All in all , the Governing Council expects price stability to be maintained over the medium term , thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households .
In line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand , overall price , cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued .
To address this challenge , banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and , where necessary , take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term .
A strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed .
Sound balance sheets , effective risk management and transparent , robust business models are key to strengthening banks » resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance , thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability .

No longer in force : Decision of the ECB of 21 November 2002 on the distribution of the income of the ECB on euro banknotes in circulation to the national central banks of the participating Member States ( ECB / 2002/9 )
When the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992 , it was decided that the ECB would be located in Frankfurt am Main .
In 1998 , as the ECB started operations in rented offices in the Eurotower , the search for a suitable future location for the ECB in Frankfurt began .
Having looked into 35 possible sites across the city , the ECB finally decided upon the site of the former Grossmarkthalle ( wholesale fruit and vegetable market ) , including the Grossmarkthalle building itself .
A feasibility study showed that this site was economically the most viable , that it was well connected from an infrastructure point of view , that the spatial requirements could be ensured , and that it was the optimum site for fulfilling the security measures necessary for a central bank .
In accordance with Articles 12.1 and 14.3 of the Statute , ECB Guidelines form an integral part of Community law ,
--- Variation margins ( marking to market ) The Eurosystem requires the haircut-adjusted market value of the underlying assets used in its liquidityproviding reverse transactions to be maintained over time .
--- Additional guarantees The Eurosystem may require additional guarantees from financially sound entities in order to accept certain assets .
--- Exclusion The Eurosystem may exclude certain assets from use in its monetary policy operations .

Opinion on the amendment of the rules on the reporting of balance of payment data ( CON / 2003/1 )
The current rates remain appropriate , taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since the meeting on 6 August 2009 .
In this respect , the Governing Council also decided that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 September 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations .
Price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon .
This is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilisation and very gradual recovery .
Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term , as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate .
Against this background , the Governing Council expects price stability to be maintained over the medium term , thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households .
With regard to the economic analysis , following the strong negative growth rates observed around the turn of the year , according to Eurostat 's first estimate , economic activity in the euro area declined only slightly in the second quarter of 2009 , contracting by 0.1% compared with the previous quarter .
Survey indicators for the third quarter of 2009 support the view that the euro area economy is stabilising further .
In the near term , the euro area should continue to benefit from a recovery in exports , the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system .
In addition , the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively .
However , uncertainty remains high and the persistent volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of available information .
Overall , the recovery is expected to be rather uneven , given the temporary nature of some of the supporting factors and the ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and non-financial sectors of the economy , both inside and outside the euro area .
Compared with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections , this implies an upward revision of the ranges for both 2009 and 2010 , reflecting mainly the recent , more positive developments and information .
In the view of the Governing Council , the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced .
On the upside , there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken .
Looking further ahead , inflation is expected to remain in positive territory , with overall price and cost developments staying subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere .
In this context , it is important to re-emphasise that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
Furthermore , increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in both broad money and credit growth .
These developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term .
The deceleration in annual M3 growth has thus continued to combine with a substantial further strengthening of annual M1 growth , which in July rose to 12.1% .
In addition , the relatively steep yield curve and the re-emergence of risk appetite , reflected particularly in the increase in stock prices over the past few months , may have dampened M3 growth to some extent .
The overall flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in July , with the differences across borrowing sectors becoming more marked .
The flow of loans to households remained slightly positive , whereas in the case of non-financial corporations the flow of loans was negative again .
The decline in loans to non-financial corporations continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity , while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive .
The fall in production and trade and the ongoing uncertainty in the business outlook are likely to have dampened firms » demand for financing .
Given the normal lag between a recovery in economic activity and a pick-up in loans to enterprises , further weak developments in loans to non-financial corporations in the coming months appear likely .
At the same time , a gradual improvement in financing conditions , as lower market interest rates continue to be passed on in lower bank lending rates , should support the demand for credit in the period ahead .
Against the background of highly demanding challenges , banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and , where necessary , take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector , particularly as regards recapitalisation .
To sum up , the information and analyses that have become available since the meeting of the Governing Council on 6 August 2009 confirm its view that the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate .
In this respect , the Governing Council also decided at its meeting on 3 September that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 September 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term , as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate .
Accordingly , the Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead .
In particular , it is crucial that ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies , underpinned by concrete structural measures , are put in place .
In countries with high deficits and / or debt ratios , the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1 % of GDP .
The focus of the structural measures should lie on the expenditure side , as in most euro area countries tax and social contribution rates are already high .
It requires , in particular , appropriate wage-setting , sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work .
At the same time , policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to ensure a sustained recovery .
In this respect , an appropriate restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector plays an important role .
The euro area NCBs , which form an integral part of the Eurosystem , carry out the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules established by the ECB 's decision-making bodies .
Securities of euro area residents denominated in euro
The techniques used are consistent with those of the Eurosystem staff projections as described in « A guide to Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection exercises » , ECB , June 2001 .
Residential private investment is projected to continue to grow at moderate rates over the horizon .
The projections for real GDP growth and employment imply that labour productivity growth will slowly pick up .
On 20 September 2010 , the ECB also received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on the proposed regulation .
On 27 September 2010 , the ECB received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a Council regulation concerning the extension of the scope of Regulation ( EU ) No xx / yy of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States ( 2 ) ( hereinafter the « proposed extending regulation ') ( hereinafter collectively referred to as the « proposed regulations ') .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Articles 127 ( 4 ) and 282 ( 5 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , since the proposed regulations contain provisions on the cross-border transportation of euro banknotes and it is the Governing Council of the ECB which has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of euro banknotes .
The notion of legal tender is also of particular importance with regard to the use of « Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems » , as defined by the proposed regulation .
As the authority having the exclusive right to authorise the issue of legal tender euro banknotes , the ECB notes that « neutralised » euro banknotes retain their legal tender status and that this has already been accepted by the Commission ( 4 ) .
More specifically , all provisions of the proposed regulation should be extended to such Member States .
Non-euro area Member States cannot be « Member States of origin » or « host Member States » in the sense of the proposed regulation .
Where the ECB recommends that the proposed regulations are amended , specific drafting proposals are set out in the Annex accompanied by explanatory text to this effect .
ANNEX Drafting proposals Text proposed by the Commission Amendments proposed by the ECB ( 1 )
Explanation While it is clear that the Member State of origin and the host Member State have to be participating Member States , it is possible that a cash-in-transit vehicle may also have to cross the territory of a non-participating Member State in order to reach a host Member State .
It cannot be the Commission 's intention to exclude participating Member States surrounded by non-participating Member States from the scope of application of the proposed regulation .
Explanation The term « NCB » is defined in Recital 1 of the proposed regulation , but has not been employed here .
Moreover , the transport of euro banknotes or coins between an NCB and a printing work / mint is always done on the account of the NCB that has ordered the relevant banknotes or coins .
For the avoidance of doubt , as from the date of the decision of the Council taken in accordance with Article 140 ( 2 ) of the Treaty to abrogate it 's a Member State 's derogation from participating in the euro , the relevant Member State may also be a « host Member State » as defined in Council Regulation ( EC ) xx / yy .'
Explanation While it is clear that the Member State of origin and the host Member State have to be participating Member States , it is geographically possible that the cash-in-transit vehicle may also have to cross non-participating Member States in order to reach a host Member State .
It cannot be in the Commission 's intention to exclude participating Member States surrounded by nonparticipating Member States from the scope of application of the proposed regulation .
For the period between the abrogation of a Member State 's derogation and the introduction of the euro in that Member State , such acceding Member State should be permitted to become a « host Member State » .

Opinion on a recommendation on the appointment of the Vice-President of the ECB ( CON / 2002/11 )
On 20 October 2005 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2004/39 / EC on markets in financial instruments , as regards certain deadlines ( 1 ) ( hereinafter the « proposed directive ') .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the first indent of Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community , since the proposed directive contains provisions which have a bearing on the functioning and integration of EU financial markets and which could possibly affect financial stability .
The ECB welcomes the extension by six months until October 2006 of the deadline by which Member States must transpose Directive 2004/39 / EC ( 2 ) into national law and the granting of an extra six months after transposition for the effective application of Directive 2004/39 / EC , steps which have proven necessary for both Member States and investment firms .
( 2 ) Directive 2004/39 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611 / EEC and 93/6 / EEC and Directive 2000/12 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22 / EEC ( OJ L 145 , 30.4.2004 , p. 1 ) .
The overview session gives information about the organisation , tasks and responsibilities of the ECB / Eurosystem / ESCB -- additionally , one of the modules below can be introduced .
The advanced session deals in-depth with one of the topics listed below .
Guided tours : we regret to say that guided tours through the building are not possible .
Throughout the current financial crisis , central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets .
Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries , partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices .
Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability .
The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability .
Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted .
Accordingly , the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the Federal Reserve , Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates .
The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions .
The Governing Council of the ECB , by means of teleconferencing , has taken the following monetary policy decisions :
The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be reduced by 50 basis points to 3.75 %, with effect from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 15 October 2008 .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 4.75 %, with immediate effect .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 2.75 %, with immediate effect .
Keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective and securing price stability in the medium term will support sustainable growth and employment and contribute to financial stability .
Information on the actions taken by the other central banks is available at the following websites :
At today 's meeting , which was held in Paris , the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions :
The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be increased by 25 basis points to 3.25% , starting from the operation to be settled on 11 October 2006 .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 4.25% , with effect from 11 October 2006 .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 2.25% , with effect from 11 October 2006 .
No longer in force : Decision of the ECB of 18 December 2006 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the ECB 's capital by the non-participating national central banks ( ECB / 2006/26 )
On 1 May 2004 ten new Member States - the Czech Republic , Estonia , Cyprus , Latvia , Lithuania , Hungary , Malta , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia -- joined the European Union .
The new countries will adopt the euro only when they fulfil certain economic criteria , namely , a high degree of price stability , a sound fiscal situation , stable exchange rates and converged long-term interest rates .
The eight euro coins are all different in terms of size , weight , material , colour and thickness .
At the end of 2009 , some 86 billion euro coins worth Euros 21 billion were in circulation .
For monthly updates of the circulation figures , please see www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/euro/circulation

Please contact the supplier for information on the availability of a user manual in the language of your choice .
The user manual lacks instructions on the method and frequency of device maintenance required to retain the proper functioning of the device .
The counterfeit euro banknotes used in the test are , to the best of the knowledge of the ECB and the NCBs , those most commonly found in circulation in the euro area at the time of the update of the test deck used in the test .
Since the ECB and the NCBs cannot foresee or exclude the possibility of new types of counterfeits appearing after the update of the test deck used , it is the responsibility of the manufacturers to regularly re-test the various types of devices .
To the extent permitted by applicable law , the ECB and the NCBs do not accept any liability whatsoever for any direct or indirect damage resulting from the performance of the tests , the publication , non-publication or removal from the Internet of the test results , or for the tests » outcomes .
For separate disclaimers of the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Banco de Portugal , please refer to footnote 1 .
The Deutsche Bundesbank does not accept any liability whatsoever for any direct or indirect damage relating to the performance of the tests , the publication , non-publication or removal from the Internet of the test results , or for the tests » outcome unless such damage is caused by intent or gross negligence on the part of the Deutsche Bundesbank .
In addition the limitation of liability as provided for in the general disclaimer of the Deutsche Bundesbank remains applicable .
Disclaimer ( ii ) for tests carried out by the Banco de Portugal :
The performance of the tests , the publication , non-publication or removal from the Internet of the test results do not imply the assumption of any liability whatsoever for any direct or indirect damage relating to such facts .
The exceptionally low level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum continues to provide considerable support to economic growth in the euro area , which currently shows only moderate dynamics .
At the same time , the Governing Council will remain vigilant with regard to upside risks to price stability .
As regards the economic analysis underlying the Governing Council 's assessment , real GDP grew by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2005 , according to first estimates , compared with 0.2% in the previous quarter .
All in all , in the judgement of the Governing Council real economic growth should gradually improve over the period ahead .
At the same time , recent data have heightened the uncertainties surrounding the short-term evolution of domestic demand , and persistently high oil prices and global imbalances may pose downside risks to the projections for economic growth .
In the June 2005 Eurosystem staff projections , average annual HICP inflation is seen to lie between 1.8% and 2.2% in 2005 , and between 0.9% and 2.1% in 2006 .
Compared with the ECB staff projections published in March 2005 , the inflation projections for 2005 have been revised slightly upwards and for 2006 slightly downwards .
Furthermore , ongoing vigilance is required in order to ensure that past price increases do not lead to second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy .
In this respect , continued responsibility on the part of social partners is very important .
The monetary analysis provides further insight into the risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .
These developments mainly reflect the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates in the euro area .
The monetary dynamics are driven by the strong growth of the most liquid components of broad money contained in the narrow aggregate M1 .
At the same time , the euro area private sector 's demand for MFI loans , in particular for house purchase , has remained strong .
The assessment of ample liquidity in the euro area is confirmed by all indicators .
In the light of , among other things , the increasingly liquid nature of monetary expansion , the accumulated stock of the broad monetary aggregate M3 may entail upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .
Standard tenders are carried out within a time frame of 24 hours .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
Strikethrough in the body of the text indicates where the ECB proposes deleting the text .
Today , the Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) decided to continue its current voting regime and to introduce the rotation system only when the number of Governors and Presidents of the euro area national central banks ( Governors ) exceeds 18 .
The decision is based on Article 10.2 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , as amended on 21 March 2003 by the EU Council , which established the principles of the new rotation system for the Governing Council .
Either decision needs to be taken by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Governing Council [ 2 ] .
At the same time , the Governing Council decided on the main aspects for the implementation of the rotation system , to be applied once the number of Governors exceeds 18 .
The number of Governors rotating will be determined by the difference between the number of Governors and the number of votes allocated to each group minus two , taking the absolute value in case of a negative number .
This rotation model achieves short periods without vote for individual Governors combined with relative stability of the composition of the voting college .
An ECB Decision on the implementation details of the rotation system will be adopted at a later stage and thereafter published in the Official Journal of the EU and on the ECB 's website .
Once the rotation system enters into force , the list of Governors with a voting right will be published on the ECB 's website and updated regularly .
[ 1 ] For a description of the rotation scheme see the ECB press release of 20 December 2002 , entitled « Governing Council prepares for enlargement » http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2002/html/index.en.html

As the institution responsible for price stability in the euro area , the ECB is committed to communicating as clearly and fully as possible with the public .
This website , which we are steadily developing , is one important way of doing so .
Consequently , most parts of The European Central Bank and of Banknotes &amp; Coins are in all the official languages of the European Union , as are many of the press releases and a number of publications .
For details , please click on « Languages » at the top of the screen .
The ECB was established in Frankfurt am Main , Germany , in June 1998 and employs around 1,350 people from all 27 EU countries .
As the central bank responsible for Europe 's single currency , the ECB works closely with the national central banks of all euro area countries in a team called the Eurosystem .
In addition , the ECB and the national central banks of all EU countries form a group called the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) .
Our main objective is to ensure that prices remain stable .

The bars in the chart show how much each product group contributes to the current inflation rate when taking both price changes and weights into account .
If you add up the corresponding values you arrive at the overall rate of HICP inflation .
A monetary policy strategy is a coherent and structured description of how monetary policy decisions will be made in order to achieve the objective of the central bank .
Second , it is a vehicle for explaining monetary policy decisions to the public ( external dimension ) .
By contributing to the effectiveness of monetary policy , and by signalling the central bank 's commitment to price stability , the strategy contributes to the credibility of the ECB in the financial markets .
The main task of the ECB as the heart of the Eurosystem is the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area with the aim to maintain price stability .
The economic analysis is aimed at assessing the short to medium-term determinants of price developments , with a focus on real activity and financial conditions in the economy .
It takes account of the fact that price developments over those horizons are influenced largely by the interplay of supply and demand in the goods , services and factor markets .
The monetary analysis focuses on a longer-term horizon , exploiting the long-run link between money and prices .
The monetary analysis mainly serves as a means of cross-checking , from a medium to long-term perspective , the short to medium-term indications for monetary policy coming from the economic analysis .

The precise starting date of the transitional period is dependent on a critical mass of NCBs agreeing to participate in the single Eurosystem tender procedure and will be decided by the Governing Council .
The single Eurosystem tender procedure recognises that issuing euro banknotes is a public task , which has been explicitly entrusted to the Eurosystem .
The single Eurosystem tender procedure consists of a single set of tender rules and procedures , which will apply to the Eurosystem 's entire banknote requirement .
NCBs with in-house printing works or those using public printing works may decide not to participate in the single Eurosystem tender procedure and will then continue to produce the euro banknotes allocated to them in those printing works .

By way of derogation from Article 28.3 , central banks of Member States with a derogation shall not pay up their subscribed capital unless the General Council , acting by a majority representing at least two thirds of the subscribed capital of the ECB and at least half of the shareholders , decides that a minimal percentage has to be paid up as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB .
Article 48 ( ex Article 49 ) Deferred payment of capital , reserves and provisions of the ECB
The central bank of a Member State whose derogation has been abrogated shall pay up its subscribed share of the capital of the ECB to the same extent as the central banks of other Member States without a derogation , and shall transfer to the ECB foreign reserve assets in accordance with Article 30.1 .
The sum to be transferred shall be determined by multiplying the euro value at current exchange rates of the foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the ECB in accordance with Article 30.1 , by the ratio between the number of shares subscribed by the national central bank concerned and the number of shares already paid up by the other national central banks .
sum to be contributed shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the reserves , as defined above and as stated in the approved balance sheet of the ECB , by the ratio between the number of shares subscribed by the central bank concerned and the number of shares already paid up by the other central banks .
Upon one or more countries becoming Member States and their respective national central banks becoming part of the ESCB , the subscribed capital of the ECB and the limit on the amount of foreign reserve assets that may be transferred to the ECB shall be automatically increased .
The increase shall be determined by multiplying the respective amounts then prevailing by the ratio , within the expanded capital key , between the weighting of the entering national central banks concerned and the weighting of the national central banks already members of the ESCB .
Each national central bank 's weighting in the capital key shall be calculated by analogy with Article 29.1 and in compliance with Article 29.2 .
The reference periods to be used for the statistical data shall be identical to those applied for the latest quinquennial adjustment of the weightings under Article 29.3 .
Article 49 ( ex Article 52 ) Exchange of banknotes in the currencies of the Member States
Following the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates in accordance with Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , the Governing Council shall take the necessary measures to ensure that banknotes denominated in currencies with irrevocably fixed exchange rates are exchanged by the national central banks at their respective par values .
If and as long as there are Member States with a derogation , Articles 42 to 47 shall be applicable .
The committees of the European Parliament shall meet in Brussels .
The General Secretariat of the European Parliament and its departments shall remain in Luxembourg .
During the months of April , June and October , the Council shall hold its meetings in Luxembourg .
The departments listed in Articles 7 , 8 and 9 of the Decision of 8 April 1965 shall be established in Luxembourg .
Declaration concerning the Protocol on the position of Denmark
The Conference notes that with respect to legal acts to be adopted by the Council acting alone or jointly with the European Parliament and containing provisions applicable to Denmark as well as provisions not applicable to Denmark because they have a legal basis to which Part I of the Protocol on the position of Denmark applies , Denmark declares that it will not use its voting right to prevent the adoption of the provisions which are not applicable to Denmark .
Furthermore , the Conference notes that on the basis of the Declaration by the Conference on Article 222 , Denmark declares that Danish participation in actions or legal acts pursuant to Article 222 will take place in accordance with Part I and Part II of the Protocol on the position of Denmark .
Furthermore , Ireland recalls that in accordance with Article 8 of the Protocol it may notify the Council in writing that it no longer wishes to be covered by the terms of the Protocol .
Ireland intends to review the operation of these arrangements within three years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
Declaration by the Italian Republic on the composition of the European Parliament
Italy likewise notes that on the basis of Article 9 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , every national of a Member State is a citizen of the Union .
Italy therefore considers that , without prejudice to the decision on the 2009-2014 legislative period , any decision adopted by the European Council , at the initiative of the European Parliament and with its consent , establishing the composition of the European Parliament , must abide by the principles laid down out in the first subparagraph of Article 14 .
Declaration by the Republic of Latvia , the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Malta on the spelling of the name of the single currency in the Treaties Without prejudice to the unified spelling of the name of the single currency of the European Union referred to in the Treaties as displayed on the banknotes and on the coins , Latvia , Hungary and Malta declare that the spelling of the name of the single currency , including its derivatives as applied throughout the Latvian , Hungarian and Maltese text of the Treaties , has no effect on the existing rules of the Latvian , Hungarian or Maltese languages .
Declaration by the Kingdom of the Netherlands on Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
The Kingdom of the Netherlands will agree to a decision as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 312 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union once a revision of the decision referred to in the third paragraph of Article 311 of that Treaty has provided the Netherlands with a satisfactory solution for its excessive negative net payment position vis-à-vis the Union budget .
( 2 ) If the normal settlement date for the main or the longer-term refinancing operations coincides with a bank holiday , the ECB may decide to apply a different settlement date , with the option of same-day settlement .
As a matter of principle , the Eurosystem aims to settle the transactions related to its open market operations at the same time in all Member States with all counterparties that have provided sufficient underlying assets .
However , owing to operational constraints and the technical features of SSSs , the timing within the day of the settlement of open market operations may differ across the euro area .
These Conditions describe the mutual rights and obligations of participants in TARGET2 - [ insert CB / country reference ] and the [ insert name of CB ] .
Furthermore , each participant shall pass a series of tests to prove its technical and operational competence before it may participate in TARGET2 - [ insert CB / country reference ] .
Participants may agree among each other on specific rules regarding the field contents .
The error codes are defined in Chapter 9.4.2 of the UDFS .
Settlement of payment orders in the entry disposition ( 1 ) Offsetting checks and , if appropriate , extended offsetting checks ( both terms as defined in paragraphs 2 and 3 ) shall be carried out on payment orders entered into the entry disposition to provide quick , liquidity-saving gross settlement of payment orders .
If an offsetting payment order does not provide sufficient funds for the respective payer 's payment order in the entry disposition , it shall be determined whether there is sufficient available liquidity on the payer 's PM account .
An extended offsetting check determines whether offsetting payment orders are available in any of the payee 's queues regardless of when they joined the queue .
However , if in the queue of the payee there are higher priority payment orders addressed to other TARGET2 participants , the FIFO principle may only be breached if settling such an offsetting payment order would result in a liquidity increase for the payee .
Different optimisation mechanisms ( algorithms ) are used .
By means of Algorithm 4 , settlement procedure 5 ( as defined in Chapter 2.8.1 of the UDFS ) shall be available for the settlement of payment instructions of ancillary systems .
To optimise the settlement of highly urgent ancillary system transactions on participants » sub-accounts , a special algorithm ( Algorithm 5 ) shall be used .
Thereafter , the [ insert name of CB ] and the other CBs involved shall , provided there are sufficient funds , settle all remaining payments ( except the extracted payment orders ) simultaneously on the PM accounts of the TARGET2 participants concerned .
The selection process shall only run for a short time , to be determined by the [ insert name of CB ] at its discretion .
After performing the checks specified under subparagraphs ( i ) to ( ii ) , the [ insert name of CB ] shall check the multilateral settlement positions ( between a participant 's PM account and other TARGET2 participants » PM accounts in relation to which a multilateral limit has been set ) .
For this purpose , the procedure described under subparagraphs ( i ) to ( ii ) shall apply mutatis mutandis .
When simultaneous multilateral settlement (' procedure 5 ') in relation to an ancillary system is pending , Algorithm 4 shall run .
( 6 ) The algorithms shall run flexibly by setting a pre-defined time lag between the application of different algorithms to ensure a minimum interval between the running of two algorithms .
Requests for reordering or revocation of a payment order shall be queued until the algorithm is complete .
If the payment order is not settled , the participant 's requests shall be taken into account immediately .
Further details are described in the ICM User Handbook .

In the case of the interfaced model , the settlement bank has to open at least one sub-account relating to a specific AS .
( 3 ) When offering cross-system settlement under settlement procedure 6 , the ASCBs and SCBs shall support cross-system settlement payments , if they are initiated by the relevant ASs .
The possibility to execute cross-system settlement between two individual ASs shall be recorded in the Static Data ( Management ) Module .
If there are several standing orders to credit different sub-accounts , they shall be settled in the order of their amount , starting with the highest .
During night-time AS operations , if there are standing orders for which there are insufficient funds on the PM account , such orders shall be settled following a pro-rata reduction of all orders ;
If there is a current order submitted by the AS for which there are insufficient funds on the PM account , such order shall be partially settled ;
Such orders shall be settled immediately .
However , for night-time ancillary system operations , the « start-of-procedure » message is sent by the ASCB .
« Start-of-procedure » messages shall trigger the settlement of standing orders for the transfer of liquidity into the sub-accounts .
The « end-of-procedure » message leads to an automatic retransfer of liquidity from the sub-account to the PM account .
( 11 ) Within each AS processing cycle , a settlement bank 's dedicated liquidity can be increased by crediting certain incoming payments directly to its sub-accounts , i.e. coupons and redemption payments .
In such cases , the liquidity first has to be credited on the technical account , then debited from such account before crediting the liquidity on the sub-account ( or on the PM account ) .
The payment instruction cannot be initiated by the AS using the integrated model whose mirror account will be credited .
In the event that settlement procedure 6 is used for the integrated model during daytime processing , only limited functionality is offered .
Standing orders submitted after the sending of the « start-of-procedure » message on a given business day shall be valid only for the next business day .
If a standing order for daytime processing is not covered , it will be rejected .
( 16 ) The rules regarding the « start-of-procedure » and « end-of-procedure » messages , as well as regarding the start and end of cycle for the interfaced model , shall apply mutatis mutandis .

The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has today published the report prepared by the European Court of Auditors on the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB for the financial year 2006 , together with the ECB 's reply to it .
The Court 's report was prepared in accordance with Article 27.2 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank .
No longer in force : Decision of the ECB of 22 April 2004 on the national central banks » percentage shares in the key for subscription to the ECB 's capital ( ECB / 2004/5 )
On 10 July 2007 , the Council of the European Union approved Cyprus » application to join the euro area on 1 January 2008 .
On 1 January 2008 , the euro became legal tender in Cyprus , replacing the Cyprus pound ( CYP ) at the irrevocably fixed exchange rate of Euros 1 = CYP 0.585274 .
The prompt pre-distribution of euro cash to professional third parties prior to 1 January 2008 helped to ensure a smooth cash changeover , alleviate the logistical burden and reduce the costs of dual currency circulation .
Some of this cash was then pre-distributed to retailers and other companies (" sub-frontloading ") .
In addition , euro coin starter kits went on sale to the public at the Central Bank of Cyprus , banks and co-operative credit societies on 3 December 2007 .
Depending on the specific national circumstances , they may also facilitate access to payment systems for all credit institutions .
The ECB has the authority to establish the necessary guidelines to implement the Eurosystem 's single monetary policy and the NCBs have an obligation to act in accordance with such guidelines .
The activities of the ESCB are carried out in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community ( Treaty ) and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( Statute of the ESCB ) .
TABLE 1 Eurosystem monetary policy operations Monetary policy operations Types of transactions Provision of liquidity Absorption of liquidity Maturity Frequency Procedure
Selection of counterparties for quick tenders and bilateral operations For outright transactions , no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties .
The criteria and procedures applied for the selection of counterparties to foreign exchange intervention operations are presented in Annex 3 .
For other operations based on quick tenders and bilateral procedures ( fine-tuning reverse transactions and the collection of fixed-term deposits ) , each national central bank selects a set of counterparties from among the institutions established in its Member State which fulfil the general counterparty eligibility criteria .
OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Open market operations play an important role in the Eurosystem 's monetary policy , pursuing the aims of steering interest rates , managing the liquidity situation in the market and signalling the stance of monetary policy .
( b ) L e g a l n a t u r e The national central banks may execute reverse transactions either in the form of repurchase agreements ( i.e. the ownership of the asset is transferred to the creditor , while the parties agree to reverse the transaction through a re-transfer of the asset to the debtor at a future point in time ) or as collateralised loans ( i.e. an enforceable security interest is provided over the assets but , assuming fulfilment of the debt obligation , the ownership of the asset is retained by the debtor ) .
Arrangements for reverse transactions based on collateralised loans take account of the different procedures and formalities required to enable the establishment and subsequent realisation of a relevant interest in the collateral ( e.g. a pledge ) which apply in different jurisdictions .
( c ) I n t e r e s t t e r m s The difference between the purchase price and the repurchase price in a repurchase agreement corresponds to the interest due on the amount of money borrowed or lent over the maturity of the operation , i.e. the repurchase price includes the respective interest to be paid .
( b ) L e g a l n a t u r e An outright transaction implies a full transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer with no connected reverse transfer of ownership .
( c ) P r i c e t e r m s In the calculation of prices , the Eurosystem acts in accordance with the most widely accepted market convention for the debt instruments used in the transaction .
( b ) L e g a l n a t u r e The certificates constitute a debt obligation of the ECB vis-à-vis the holder of the certificate .
They are used for fine-tuning purposes , mainly with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates .
( b ) L e g a l n a t u r e Foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes refer to operations where the Eurosystem buys ( or sells ) euro spot against a foreign currency and , at the same time , sells ( or buys ) it back in a forward transaction at a specified repurchase date .
( c ) C u r r e n c y a n d e x c h a n g e r a t e t e r m s As a rule , the Eurosystem operates only in widely traded currencies and in accordance with standard market practice .
( b ) L e g a l n a t u r e The deposits accepted from counterparties are for a fixed term and with a fixed rate of interest .
( d ) M a t u r i t y a n d i n t e r e s t t e r m s The maturity of credit extended under the facility is overnight .
( e ) S u s p e n s i o n o f t h e f a c i l i t y Access to the facility is granted only in accordance with the objectives and general monetary policy considerations of the ECB .
No collateral is given to the counterparty in exchange for the deposits .
( d ) M a t u r i t y a n d i n t e r e s t t e r m s The maturity of deposits under the facility is overnight .
The Eurosystem may select , according to the criteria and procedures specified in Section 2.2 , a limited number of counterparties to participate in quick tenders .
( c ) F i n e - t u n i n g o p e r a t i o n s Fine-tuning operations are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar .
If , at the lowest interest rate level accepted ( i.e. the marginal interest rate ) , the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted , the remaining amount is allocated pro rata among the bids according to the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal interest rate ( see Box 5 ) .
For other liquidity-absorbing operations , the amount allotted to each counterparty is rounded to the nearest euro .
If , at the highest swap point quotation accepted ( i.e. the marginal swap point quotation ) , the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted , the remaining amount is allocated pro rata among the bids according to the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation ( see Box 6 ) .
( d ) T y p e o f a u c t i o n For variable rate tenders , the Eurosystem may apply either single rate or multiple rate auction procedures .
In a single rate auction ( Dutch auction ) , the allotment interest rate / price / swap point applied for all satisfied bids is equal to the marginal interest rate / price / swap point ( i.e. that at which the total allotment is exhausted ) .
In a multiple rate auction ( American auction ) , the allotment interest rate / price / swap point is equal to the interest rate / price / swap point offered for each individual bid .
The national central banks will directly certify the individual allotment result to successful counterparties .
( b ) D i r e c t c o n t a c t w i t h c o u n t e r p a r t i e s In this procedure , the national central banks directly contact one or a few domestic counterparties , which are selected according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 .
Counterparties without a safe custody account with a national central bank or a securities settlement account with an SSS fulfilling the ECB 's minimum standards may settle the transactions of underlying assets through the securities settlement account or the safe custody account of a correspondent credit institution .
The time of settlement of the main and the longer-term refinancing operations normally coincides with the time of reimbursement of a previous operation of corresponding maturity .
The Eurosystem aims to settle open market operations based on quick tenders and bilateral procedures on the trade day .
However , the Eurosystem may , for operational reasons , occasionally apply other settlement dates for these operations , in particular for outright transactions ( for fine-tuning as well as structural purposes ) and foreign exchange swaps ( see Table 3 ) .
No further payment orders are accepted for processing in the national RTGS systems after the closing time , although remaining payment orders accepted before the closing time are still processed .
Any negative balances on the settlement accounts ( in the national RTGS systems ) of eligible counterparties remaining after the finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures are automatically considered to be a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility ( see Section 4.1 ) .
They must be held ( settled ) in the euro area through an account with the Eurosystem or with an SSS which fulfils the standards established by the ECB ( so that perfection and realisation are subject to the law of a euro area country ) .
Furthermore , market liquidity may be taken into account by the ECB when determining the eligibility of individual debt instruments .
( 6 ) So that perfection and realisation are subject to the law of a Member State of the euro area .
They are not normally used in Eurosystem outright transactions .
--- Limits in relation to issuers / debtors or guarantors The Eurosystem may apply limits to the exposure vis-à-vis issuers / debtors or guarantors .
The reporting framework for the ECB 's money and banking statistics includes the possibility to relieve small institutions of some of the reporting burden .
The reserve requirement for each maintenance period is rounded to the nearest euro .
Non-compliance with minimum reserve obligations Non-compliance with the minimum reserve obligations arises if an institution 's average end-of-calendar-day balance on its reserve account ( s ) over the maintenance period is less than its reserve requirement for the corresponding maintenance period .
The ECB decides to allot EUR 94 million , implying a marginal interest rate of 3,05 %.
All bids above 3,05 % ( for a cumulative amount of EUR 80 million ) are fully satisfied .
If the allotment procedure follows a single rate ( Dutch ) auction , the interest rate applied to the amounts allotted to the counterparties is 3,05 %.
The ECB decides to allot a nominal amount of EUR 124,5 million , implying a marginal interest rate of 3,05 %.
All bids below 3,05 % ( for a cumulative amount of EUR 65 million ) are fully satisfied .
All bids above 6,63 ( for a cumulative amount of EUR 65 million ) are fully satisfied .
The ECB fixes the spot EUR / USD exchange rate for the operation at 1,1300 .
If the allotment procedure follows a single rate ( Dutch ) auction , at the start date of the operation the Eurosystem buys EUR 158 000 000 and sells USD 178 540 000 .
The ECB decides to allot EUR 197 million , implying 6,54 marginal swap points .
All bids below 6,54 ( for a cumulative amount of EUR 195 million ) are fully satisfied .
If the allotment procedure follows a single rate ( Dutch ) auction , at the start date of the operation the Eurosystem sells EUR 197 000 000 and buys USD 222 610 000 .

The Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) approved on 11 March 2005 the audited annual accounts of the ECB for the year ending 31 December 2004 .
The ECB made a net loss of Euros 1,636 million in 2004 , compared with a net loss of Euros 477 million in 2003 .
This loss was again due primarily to the evolution of exchange rates , which adversely affected the value , expressed in euro , of the bank 's holdings of assets denominated in foreign currencies , principally the US dollar .
The ECB 's accounting policies pay particular attention to the principle of prudence .
Accordingly , unrealised exchange rate and market price revaluation losses on the ECB 's holdings of foreign currency assets and gold are treated as realised and taken to the profit and loss account at year-end .
However , unrealised exchange rate and market price revaluation gains on the ECB 's holdings of foreign currency assets and gold are not recognised as profit , but transferred directly to revaluation accounts .
In 2004 the appreciation of the euro resulted in net exchange rate revaluation losses of almost Euros 2.1 billion .
The ECB 's regular income is derived primarily from investment earnings on its holding of foreign reserve assets and its paid-up capital of Euros 4.1 billion and from interest income on its 8 % share of the euro banknotes in circulation .
Interest income in 2004 was again adversely affected by low interest rates on both domestic and foreign currency assets .
The ECB paid remuneration of Euros 693 million to the national central banks ( NCBs ) on their claims in respect of the foreign reserve assets transferred by them to the ECB .
The ECB 's administrative expenses on salaries and related costs , rental of premises , and goods and services amounted to Euros 340 million ( Euros 286 million in 2003 ) .
The main single factor in this increase was a provision against a rise in the ECB 's pension fund obligations , calculated on an actuarial basis .
Depreciation charges on fixed assets amounted to Euros 34 million .
At the end of 2004 , the ECB employed 1,309 staff ( including 131 at managerial levels ) compared with 1,213 one year earlier .
On 11 March 2005 , the Governing Council decided , first , to offset the ECB 's net loss of Euros 1,636 million against its entire general reserve fund of Euros 296 million and , second , to offset the remaining loss of Euros 1,340 million against the monetary income allocated to national central banks for the financial year 2004 in proportion to the amounts allocated to each national central bank .
This prudent approach applies particularly to the differing treatment of unrealised gains and unrealised losses for the purpose of recognising income , and to the prohibition against netting unrealised losses on one asset against unrealised gains on another .
All NCBs voluntarily apply broadly the same policies as the ECB in preparing their own annual financial statements .
Remuneration of foreign reserve assets transferred to the ECB : On transferring foreign reserve assets to the ECB upon joining the Eurosystem , each NCB acquired a remunerated claim on the ECB for the value of the amount it transferred .
The Governing Council has decided that these claims should be denominated in euro , and should be remunerated on a daily basis at the latest main refinancing rate of the Eurosystem , adjusted to take account of the zero rate of return on the gold component .
In 2004 this remuneration resulted in an interest expense of some Euros 693 million , compared with net interest income of Euros 422 million earned on the foreign reserve assets .
Based on the ECB 's estimated financial result for the year ending 31 December 2004 , the Governing Council decided in December 2004 :
a ) to recall the three interim quarterly distributions already paid to the NCBs during the year amounting to Euros 536 million in total ;
b ) to withhold the final quarterly interim distribution of Euros 197 million .
Allocation of losses : Under Article 33.2 of the Statute of the ESCB , a loss incurred by the ECB is to be covered in the following order :
The loss may be offset against the general reserve fund of the ECB and , if necessary , following a decision by the Governing Council , against the monetary income of the relevant financial year .
NCBs were accordingly able to make appropriate provision in their own annual accounts for 2004 before they were closed .

Recommendation of the ECB of 16 July 2004 on the statistical reporting requirements of the ECB in the field of balance of payments and international investment position statistics , and the international reserves template ( ECB / 2004/16 )
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) is today providing further details on assets eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations .
The Governing Council has decided that the marketable assets which have been issued prior to 31 May 2007 and are traded on non-regulated markets that currently fulfil the Eurosystem 's requirements for safety and accessibility , but not for transparency , will remain eligible until 31 December 2009 and will become ineligible thereafter .
The uncovered marketable tier two assets issued by credit institutions will be phased out on 31 May 2007 and become ineligible after that date .
The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be increased by 25 basis points to 3.50% , starting from the operation to be settled on 13 December 2006 .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 4.50% , with effect from 13 December 2006 .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 2.50% , with effect from 13 December 2006 .
The Eurosystem 's staff macroeconomic projection exercises play an important role in the economic analysis .
The projections , which are produced under the responsibility of the staff , help to structure and synthesise a large amount of economic data and ensure consistency across different sources of economic evidence .
In this respect , they are a key element in sharpening the assessment of economic prospects and the short to medium-term fluctuations of inflation around its trend .
Asset prices and financial yields can be used to derive information about inflation expectations in the financial markets .
For example , when buying and selling bonds , financial market participants implicitly express expectations about future developments in interest rates and prices .
Using a variety of techniques , the ECB can analyse financial prices to extract the markets » implicit expectations for future price developments .

financial infrastructure permits the transfer of payments as well as the trading , clearing and settlement of securities .
This assessment is done in collaboration with the EU national central banks and supervisory authorities through the ESCB 's Banking Supervision Committee .
At the ECB itself , financial stability monitoring and assessment is performed in several business areas : Financial Stability and Supervision as coordinator , Economics , Market Operations , International and European Relations , and Payments and Market Infrastructures .
The ECB sometimes contributes to the deliberations on its own initiative .
The BSC comprises high-level representatives from the ECB and the central banks of the ESCB as well as from the national banking supervisory authorities in those EU countries where the central bank is not responsible for banking supervision .
Good cooperation and frequent exchanges of information are essential to maintain financial stability both in normal circumstances and in times of crisis .
Finance ministries are also involved in these exchanges if a crisis is to be managed and resolved .
To place this cooperation on a proper footing , all the authorities have signed a Memorandum of Understanding .
The institutional framework for financial stability in the EU is based on two components : crisis prevention , and crisis management and resolution .
A high-level team of experts , the de Larosière Group , was set up in 2008 to make proposals for improving financial supervision in the European Union .
In its report in February 2009 the group acknowledged that the financial crisis was partly caused by inadequate financial regulation and supervision , and it urged the European Union to move towards a new regulatory agenda , stronger coordinated supervision and effective crisis management procedures .
Notably , it proposed that an enhanced European financial supervisory framework should be based on the creation of two institutions that would take care of micro - and macro-prudential supervision at the EU level .
Following the support of the EU leaders at their meeting in June 2009 , the European Commission on 23 September 2009 presented its legislative proposals on the establishment of
The proposals are now being discussed by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament .
Prudential regulation is based on a largely harmonised EU-wide regulatory framework , for which the European Commission is mainly responsible .

Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors ( CEIOPS ) .
The ECB and the central banks without supervisory responsibilities are present in the CEBS as non-voting members .
Financial stability monitoring and assessment is regularly performed at EU level .
The Economic and Financial Committee ( EFC ) reviews financial stability issues semi-annually in its Financial Stability Table ( FST ) format , which convenes high-ranked representatives from the Ministries of Finance , national central banks , the ECB , the Commission , and the Chairs of the Banking Supervision Committee ( BSC ) of the ESCB and of the EU Lamfalussy committees of supervisors .
Central banks can seek to restore normal liquidity conditions in money markets or take steps to ensure the smooth operation of market infrastructures , such as payment systems .
Governments can refinance banks or introduce emergency legislation .

At today 's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 4.00% , 5.00% and 3.00% respectively .

A feasibility study , conducted jointly with the Frankfurt architecture office Jourdan &amp; Müller in 1999 , concluded that the site of the Grossmarkthalle was eminently suitable for the construction of the ECB 's new premises and that the old market hall itself could be well incorporated into the ECB 's new headquarters .
The Grossmarkthalle site between the Osthafen docks and the city centre already has sound infrastructure links , also a legacy of the functional requirements of the former wholesale market .
For instance , the street on the western side of the Grossmarkthalle ( Oskar-von-Miller-Strasse ) has been fully redeveloped with residential and office buildings .
The ECB 's move to the Grossmarkthalle site constitutes one key component in the urban development of the Ostend district .
Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Rev. 2 and amending Council Regulation ( EEC ) N° 3037/90 and certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains ( COM ( 2006 ) 39 ) , pdf 350 kB , en
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the first indent of Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and on Article 5 ( 3 ) of the HICP Regulation .
The objective of the proposed regulation is to establish minimum standards for price collection periods within each month in order to improve the comparability of the harmonised indices of consumer prices ( HICPs ) across Member States and the reliability of the euro area HICP .
Because price collection periods differ across Member States , for some items covered by the HICPs short-term variations of prices within a month may lead to significant differences in estimated price changes .
The ECB understands that the proposed regulation shall not preclude the release of provisional HICP or HICP flash estimates and shall not affect the current release timetable for the euro area HICP .
The ECB agrees with the proposed implementation from January 2007 onwards , given that no systematic effects on measured annual or monthly price changes are expected .
Therefore , it is not expected that the revision of back-data will be necessary .
At its meeting on 3 August 2006 , the Governing Council decided to increase the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points to 3.0% .
The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also increased by 25 basis points to 4.0% and 2.0% respectively .
The decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
Also after this increase , the key ECB interest rates remain low in both real and nominal terms , money and credit growth remain strong , and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures .
The ECB 's monetary policy therefore continues to be accommodative .
If the Governing Council 's assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed , a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted .
Moreover , the available information on economic activity in the second quarter -- such as various confidence surveys and monthly indicators -- supports the view that economic growth has continued at a sustained pace .
The survey information so far available for the third quarter is also in line with the Governing Council 's baseline scenario .
Looking further ahead , the conditions are in place for real GDP in the euro area to grow at around its potential rate , as projected by Eurosystem staff in June .
Growth in the economies of the euro area 's main trading partners is providing ongoing support for euro area exports .
Investment growth is expected to continue benefiting from favourable financing conditions , corporate balance sheet restructuring , and improvements in earnings and business efficiency .
Consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time , in line with developments in employment growth and hence real disposable income .
This generally favourable outlook for economic activity in the euro area is also reflected in forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions .
Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term , although recent geopolitical tensions and their impact on markets are a timely reminder of the uncertainties that are faced by the Governing Council .
Medium to longer-term risks lie on the downside and relate in particular to the potential for further oil price rises , a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and protectionist pressures , especially after the suspension of the Doha Round of trade talks .
Turning to price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in July 2006 , unchanged from June and May .
In the second half of 2006 , and on average in 2007 , inflation rates are likely to remain above 2 %, the precise levels depending very much on future energy price developments .
While the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007 -- also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures , particularly in the manufacturing sector -- indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year .
Against this background , it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities .
Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons , the Governing Council 's assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail is confirmed by the monetary analysis .
On an annual basis , loans to the private sector as a whole have continued to increase at double-digit rates over recent months , with borrowing both by households and by non-financial corporations rising rapidly .
Ongoing strong lending to households continues to be explained , in particular , by borrowing for house purchases .
The dynamic growth of money and credit , in an environment of already ample liquidity , points to increased upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons .
Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring , particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets .
To sum up , annual inflation rates are expected to remain elevated , at above 2 % on average , in 2006 and 2007 , with risks to this outlook on the upside .
Given strong monetary and credit growth in a context of ample liquidity , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term .
A further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted .
By acting in a timely fashion , the Governing Council has helped to anchor medium and long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability , thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation .
Looking ahead , given that the ECB 's monetary policy continues to be accommodative , a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted if the Governing Council 's assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed .
The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise .
Concerning fiscal policies , given the outlook for economic growth , it is of crucial importance that euro area governments avoid pro-cyclical policies and step up the pace of fiscal consolidation .
As budgetary targets for the current year are not particularly ambitious , a rigorous implementation of plans on the expenditure side is especially warranted , and any additional windfall revenues are best used for deficit reduction .
Beyond the implementation of such prudent policies in the remainder of this year , the medium-term focus of fiscal policies should be on correcting the underlying sources of imbalances in public finances .
Euro area governments , many of which are now finalising their budget plans for 2007 , should take full advantage of the economic environment to bring forward the structural adjustment necessary for the durable correction of excessive deficits , so as to reach their medium-term budgetary objectives at an early stage and thereby prepare public finances for the acute demographic challenges they must cope with .
Exploiting the opportunities of the Single Market will help to safeguard the prosperity of the citizens of Europe .
For those Member States which have fulfilled the convergence criteria laid down by the Treaty and participate in the euro area , the considerable benefits of the Internal Market are further enhanced by the single currency , which offers them a credible framework for monetary policy and price stability in an environment characterised by the absence of exchange rate uncertainty within the euro area , low long-term interest rates , price and cost transparency , reduced transaction and information costs and stronger insurance against economic and financial instability .
In this respect , the further enlargement of the euro area on 1 January 2007 with the entry of Slovenia will be a new historical landmark .
In order to fully reap the advantages of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to operate efficiently within the enlarged currency area , it will be necessary to fully integrate Slovenia into Economic and Monetary Union , which calls for all remaining barriers to be removed , including those related to labour mobility .
Indeed , open , competitive and flexible markets are of particular importance for the functioning of the euro area economy and the smooth conduct of the single monetary policy .
For its part , the Governing Council has undertaken all the necessary preparations to make Banka Slovenije an integral part of the Eurosystem .

At its meeting on 4 December , on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 75 basis points .
At the same time , the Governing Council notes that , while the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong , it has continued to decelerate further .
The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective in order to support sustainable growth and employment and contribute to financial stability .
Accordingly , it will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead .
In the euro area , a number of the downside risks to economic activity that were identified previously have materialised , leading in the third quarter to a contraction of 0.2% in real GDP growth , on a quarterly basis , according to Eurostat 's first estimate .
Available survey data and the monthly indicators for October and November suggest that economic activity has weakened further during the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Looking further ahead , on the basis of the Governing Council 's analysis and assessment , global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand are seen as persisting in the next few quarters .
According to the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area , a subsequent recovery should then gradually take place , supported by the fall in commodity prices and assuming that the external environment improves and the financial tensions weaken .
The significant decline in headline inflation since the summer mainly reflects the considerable easing in global commodity prices over the past few months , which more than offsets the impact of the sharp rise in unit labour costs in the first half of this year .
Depending primarily on future developments in oil and other commodity prices , a faster decline in HICP inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year , mainly due to base effects .
However , also due to base effects , inflation rates could increase again in the second half of the year , so that any sharp fall in HICP inflation should be short-lived and is therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective .
The HICP inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards substantially in relation to the September 2008 ECB staff projections , reflecting mainly the large declines in commodity prices and the impact of weakening demand on price developments .
Forecasts from international organisations give a broadly similar picture .
Looking through the shorter-term volatility in headline HICP inflation rates , risks to price stability at the policy-relevant horizon are more balanced than in the past .
Unexpected further declines in commodity prices could put downward pressure on inflation , while upside risks to price stability could materialise , particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed .
It is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities .
Turning to the monetary analysis , various estimates of underlying broad money growth point to a sustained but moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area .
Monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing further , with some risks remaining on the upside in the medium to longer term .
It should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-September marks a potential watershed in the evolution of monetary developments .
The most recent money and credit data indicate that this intensification has had a significant impact on the behaviour of market participants .
Thus far , such developments have largely taken the form of substitution among components of the broad aggregate M3 , rather than sharp changes in the evolution of M3 itself .
The latest available data , namely up to the end of October , reveal a continued moderation of the growth rate of loans to the non-financial private sector .
At the same time , for the euro area as a whole , there were no significant indications of a drying up in the availability of loans .
The annual growth rate of loans to households also moderated further , in line with the weakening of economic and housing market prospects and tighter financing conditions .
To sum up , there is increased evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further and inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon , supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings .
While the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong , it has continued to decelerate further .
Hence , when considering all available information and analysis , the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 75 basis points .
All in all , the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high .
Regarding fiscal policies , the Governing Council considers it crucial that discipline and a medium-term perspective are maintained , taking fully into account the consequences of any shorter-term action on fiscal sustainability .
It is of the utmost importance that the public 's confidence in the soundness of fiscal policies is preserved , with the rules-based EU fiscal framework being fully applied and its integrity being fully preserved .
The provisions of the Treaty of Nice and the Stability and Growth Pact require a medium-term perspective and allow for the necessary flexibility .
Automatic fiscal stabilisers are relatively large in the euro area and provide a powerful source of fiscal support to a weakening economy .
Where room for manoeuvre exists , additional budgetary measures could be effective if they are timely , targeted and temporary .
Turning to structural policies , the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy .
Labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting , as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions .
The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition .

Designing and issuing the coins is the competence of the individual euro countries .
Coins jointly issued by all euro countries
So far , there are two commemorative coins that the euro countries have issued jointly : the first , in March 2007 , to commemorate the « 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome » and , in the case of the second , in January 2009 , the tenth anniversary of the euro is celebrated with a coin featuring the « 10th anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union » .
As a rule , euro countries may each issue only one Euros 2 commemorative coin per year .

Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area .
Investment is expected to remain strong , benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions , balance sheet restructuring , accumulated and ongoing strong earnings , and gains in business efficiency .
It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .

Issuing volume : varies from country to country
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has adopted its opinion , as requested by the Council of the European Union , on the proposed directive on payment services in the internal market .
The proposed directive is a very welcome initiative , as it establishes a comprehensive legal framework for payment services in the EU .
Currently , there is a wide variety of national legislation related to payments , which makes the implementation of the Single Euro Payment Area ( SEPA ) problematic .
Harmonisation of legal requirements for payments is therefore a vital measure that will assist the banking industry in its efforts to establish the SEPA .
Despite this generally positive assessment , the ECB opinion identifies some aspects of the proposed directive which should be adapted to preserve the smooth functioning of the payment system infrastructure .
In particular , the ECB has a number of concerns regarding the scope of the activities of « payment institutions » , a new concept established by the proposed directive .
In this respect , there should be adequate safeguards against the risks incurred and posed by payment institutions .
If payment institutions are allowed to hold balances which in both economic and legal terms qualify as deposits , the level of safeguards should be the same as that applied to credit and / or e-money institutions .
If the Council and the European Parliament introduce this new category of payment institutions , the proposed directive should be amended to make it explicitly clear that payment institutions may not use customers » funds during the limited time period that the funds are being transferred from the payer to the payee .
If negotiations are prolonged , the option of splitting the directive should then be considered , giving priority to adopting the parts necessary for a successful implementation of the SEPA .
Member of the ECB 's Executive Board
On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided at its meeting on 6 August to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
The information and analyses that have become available since the Governing Council 's meeting on 2 July 2009 confirm the view that the current rates remain appropriate .
As anticipated , annual HICP inflation in July fell further into negative territory , reflecting mainly temporary effects .
After a return to positive inflation rates during the second half of the year , the Governing Council continues to expect price developments to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon .
Recent data releases and survey information still suggest that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak , although the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down .
This assessment takes into account adverse lagged effects , such as a further deterioration in labour markets , which are likely to materialise over the coming months .
Looking ahead into next year , after a phase of stabilisation , a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected .
The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure , as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate .
Against this background , the Governing Council expects the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term , thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households .
The economic data and survey information that have become available since the Governing Council 's meeting on 2 July 2009 have broadly confirmed previous expectations .
While uncertainty is still high , there are increasingly signs that the global recession is bottoming out .
The significant policy stimuli in all major economic areas should support growth globally , including in the euro area .
Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected .
Consistent with available forecasts and projections , looking further ahead , inflation is expected to remain in positive territory , while price and cost developments are expected to remain subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the latest data confirm the ongoing deceleration in broad money and credit growth .
The annual growth rates of M3 and of loans to the private sector recorded in June -- 3.5% and 1.5% respectively -- are the lowest since the start of Stage Three of EMU .
The declining pace of monetary expansion since the last quarter of 2008 continues to be accompanied by volatility in the short-term developments of M3 and its components .
This reflects to a large extent the impact that absolute and relative changes in interest rates have had on the allocation of funds between financial investments inside and outside M3 and between the different deposit categories within M3 .
In this respect , the shift in allocation from short-term time deposits to overnight deposits within M3 has led to a further substantial strengthening of annual M1 growth in June .
The flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in June , albeit with differences across borrowing sectors .
The ongoing uncertainty seems to have dampened borrowers » demand for financing .
However , according to the latest euro area bank lending survey , lenders tightened their credit standards to a significantly lesser extent .
Given the challenges that lie ahead , banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and , where necessary , take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector , particularly as regards recapitalisation .
To sum up , the information and analyses that have become available since the meeting of the Governing Council on 2 July 2009 confirm its view that the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure , as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate .
As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags , the Governing Council 's policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full .
Hence , with all the measures taken , including the covered bond purchases , monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations .
Budget plans for 2010 , which are currently being finalised in a number of countries , and medium-term consolidation strategies must reflect a commitment to a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances .
Accordingly , governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact .
In countries with high deficits and / or debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1 % of GDP .
Given the risks of lower potential economic growth in the euro area for a prolonged period of time , governments should adjust public expenditures appropriately to the new macroeconomic conditions and reverse the sharp rises in public expenditure ratios as soon as possible .
This is necessary also to prepare government budgets for future ageing-induced expenditure burdens .
Turning to structural policies , there is a need to intensify structural reform efforts in order to support sustainable growth in the euro area .
Appropriate wage-setting and sufficient flexibility to get the unemployed back into work are crucial to prevent the crisis from having a lasting negative impact on labour markets .
It is therefore essential to create appropriate incentives to work .

A Euros 2 coin and the plaster model on which it was based .
This will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
Therefore , looking ahead , acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted .
Domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its momentum .
Furthermore , renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded .
It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities .
The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons .
Following several years of robust monetary growth , the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures .
Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring , particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area .
Given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term .
A transitional period , which allows both NCBs and printing works to prepare for this long-term approach , should start as soon as it has been ascertained that the production of at least half of the total annual Eurosystem euro banknote requirement will be tendered and at least half of all NCBs will tender the production of euro banknotes allocated to them .
During the transitional period the single Eurosystem tender procedure will apply to those NCBs which tender the euro banknote production allocated to them for issuance .
In line with the ECB 's general transparency policy , tender procedure information such as the eligibility and award criteria and the outcome of such procedures should be published .
Moreover , the Eurosystem needs to pay due regard to the possible impact of the production of euro banknotes on public health and safety and on the environment .
In such cases these inhouse or public printing works shall be excluded from the single Eurosystem tender procedure and they shall produce the euro banknotes allocated to their NCBs in accordance with the capital key .
They may , however , decide to participate in the single Eurosystem tender procedure at a later date .
Such a decision shall be irreversible .

All printing works that have not yet been accredited in accordance with paragraph 1 ( c ) and which are legally established in the EU may obtain information from the ECB relating to the requirements set out in this Article .
Before releasing this information , or part of it , the Governing Council shall , acting on a proposal from the Executive Board , assess whether the printing works requesting information are bona fide .
In particular , the Governing Council shall check , in accordance with any applicable national laws and regulations , the personal records of the owners and managers of the printing works concerned .
If these checks reveal that any owner or manager of the printing works requesting information has been convicted for an offence concerning their professional conduct , such information shall not be released to the printing works requesting information .
If an in-house or a public printing works that participates in the single Eurosystem tender procedure is disqualified , the production of the euro banknotes allocated to its NCB in accordance with the capital key shall be tendered in accordance with the single Eurosystem tender procedure .
The Procurement Committee shall adopt and document any decisions in this respect .

These supply agreements shall comply with the minimum common features set out in Annex II to this Guideline .
The Executive Board shall be provided with copies of the supply agreements entered into by the contracting authorities with the abovementioned printing works .
Written notification thereof shall be given to the printing works concerned .
Comprehensive details of the management , acceptance and validation ( on the basis of quantity and quality checks ) of the euro banknotes must be laid down in supply agreements .
Supply agreements must contain a clause on the reporting of production progress , in accordance with the standards and procedures to be defined separately by the ECB .
Supply agreements must contain a clause on over / underproduction of euro banknotes .
The amount of allowed over / underproduction and their treatment must be specified separately by the ECB , and must be accurately reported to the ECB in the frame of the common reporting system on production progress .
In addition , supply agreements must contain a clause prohibiting printing works from holding stocks of excess euro banknotes after a supply agreement has been fulfilled .
Contracting authorities should introduce appropriate contractual safeguards into their supply agreements to the effect that the amount and delivery schedule of ordered euro banknotes may be changed within the limits established by the ECB .
The contracting authorities must have the right to withhold payment of any invoice or part of an invoice when situations arise that are not in accordance with the supply agreements , particularly in the case of any defect in or non-compliance of the delivered euro banknotes with the EBQR .
Supply agreements must expressly differentiate between level 1 quality control by the printing works concerned , and level 2 quality validation by the contracting authority in accordance with the EBQR .
The printing works must undertake to respect all these standards and to produce euro banknotes in strict compliance with the said quality control procedures .
A contractual penalty clause ( or any other appropriate remedy ) must be included in the supply agreements .
For example , if any quality / quantity defects are detected within a predefined period laid down in the supply agreements , the contracting authority must oblige the respective printing works to replace the defective euro banknotes at no extra cost within a reasonable period defined beforehand .
These rules will be decided separately by the Executive Board taking into account the Banknote Committee 's views .
In particular , all information disclosed by contracting authorities to the printing works , but excluding any information that is in or enters the public domain , must be treated as strictly confidential and must not be disclosed to any third parties without the prior written consent of the contracting authority .
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 3 March 2008 at the request of the Council of the European Union on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries and repealing Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1172/95 ( CON / 2008/12 ) ( 2008 / C 70/01 ) Introduction and legal basis On 7 February 2008 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries and repealing Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1172/95 ( 1 ) ( hereinafter the « proposed Regulation ') .
In the Member States , external trade statistics are also used as a source for compiling balance of payments and national accounts statistics , as well as for national contributions to the euro area balance of payments and euro area accounts for which the ECB is responsible .
As expressed in a previous opinion ( 1 ) , the ECB shares the interest expressed by the European Parliament in monitoring the international role of the euro .
In this context , the ECB particularly welcomes Article 6 ( 3 ) of the proposed Regulation , which requires the compilation of statistics on trade broken down by invoicing currency of exports and imports of goods to and from countries outside the EU .
The ECB monitors the use of the euro outside the euro area and publishes an annual review on the international role of the euro , including a specific section on the use of the euro in international trade .
The international role of the euro has a strong regional dimension and is most pronounced in the EU .
Data on the currency breakdown of external trade is also a key source used in the ECB 's macroeconomic projections , which are used to analyse price stability , as they provide information on the extent to which exchange rate changes influence movements in the price of imports and domestically produced goods .
The ECB understands that the proposed Regulation may imply amendments to Intrastat reporting , as established by Regulation ( EC ) No 638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and repealing Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 3330/91 ( 2 ) , and recommends that these amendments be considered without delay .

Of the 27 EU Member States today , 16 ( Belgium , Germany , Ireland , Greece , Spain , France , Italy , Cyprus , Luxembourg , Malta , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia and Finland ) have adopted the euro , meaning that they participate fully in Stage Three of EMU .
Two - Denmark and the United Kingdom - have a special status , which means that in protocols annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community ( EC Treaty ) they were granted the exceptional right to choose whether or not to participate in Stage Three of EMU .
Further , the Convergence Reports also take account of market integration , the situation and development of balances of payments on the current account and the development of unit labour costs and other price indices .
The Committees assist the work of the decision-making bodies of the ECB , which can request them to provide any information in their fields of expertise in order to facilitate the decision-making process and the implementation of decisions .
Moreover , representatives of other competent bodies may also be invited , such as national supervisory authorities in the case of the Banking Supervisory Committee .
The Information Technology Committee ( ITC ) assists in the development , implementation and maintenance of IT networks and communications infrastructures which support the joint operational systems .
The Internal Auditors Committee ( IAC ) develops common standards for auditing Eurosystem operations and audits joint projects and joint operational systems at the Eurosystem / ESCB level .
The International Relations Committee ( IRC ) assists in the performance of the ECB 's statutory tasks with regard to international cooperation and acts as a forum for exchanging views on matters of common interest in the field of international relations .
The Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) mainly advises on strategic and longer-term issues relating to the formulation of the monetary and exchange rate policy and is responsible for the Eurosystem staff projections .
In 1998 , the Governing Council also established a Budget Committee ( BUCOM ) , composed of representatives of the ECB and the Eurosystem NCBs , which assists and reports directly to the Governing Council in matters related to the ECB 's budget .
The Human Resources Conference ( HRC ) was established in 2005 and includes the heads of personnel of all EU central banks .
At its meeting on 8 June the Governing Council of the ECB decided to increase the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points to 2.75% .
The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also increased by 25 basis points to 3.75% and 1.75% respectively .
This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that have been identified through both the Governing Council 's economic and monetary analyses .
Overall , after this increase , the key ECB interest rates are still low by historical standards , liquidity is ample and monetary policy remains accommodative .
The expected re-acceleration of real GDP growth in the first months of 2006 has thus materialised , confirming the Governing Council 's view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained .
Growth in the economies of the euro area 's main trading partners remains robust , providing support for euro area exports .
Investment growth is expected to continue to benefit from favourable financing conditions , corporate balance sheet restructuring , and gains in earnings and business efficiency .
Consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time , in line with developments in real disposable income , as the labour market situation gradually improves .
This outlook is also reflected in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections , which provide additional input into the Governing Council 's analysis of the prospects for economic activity .
The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.8% and 2.4% in 2006 , and between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2007 .
Most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture .
It is the Governing Council 's view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term , while longer-term downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises , global imbalances and protectionism .
Turning to price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , annual HICP inflation increased to 2.5% in May , compared with 2.4% in April and 2.2% in March .
Although no detailed information is available as yet , this increase probably stems from energy price developments .
Further input into the Governing Council 's assessment of the outlook for price developments is provided by the June Eurosystem staff projections .
Annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 2.1% and 2.5% in 2006 , and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007 .
Compared with the March 2006 ECB staff projections , these ranges imply a slight upward shift to the profile for HICP inflation in 2006 , largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices .
The rapid rate of monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components .
Thus , the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion , which signals inflationary risks over the medium to longer term .
To sum up , annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 , with risks to this outlook on the upside .
Given the strength of monetary and credit growth and the ample liquidity situation , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail .
By acting in a timely fashion , the Governing Council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability , thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation .
Overall , monetary policy remains accommodative and the Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise .
In terms of structural reforms , the Governing Council reiterates its call for the implementation of firm measures to ensure open , competitive and well-functioning product and labour markets , so as to foster an attractive environment for investment and innovation and to promote flexibility in wages and prices .
There is a broad and firm consensus that such reforms are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and in enhancing the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks .
At the same time , these reforms would further facilitate intra-euro area adjustments by reducing rigidities which , in some economies , contribute to wage developments that lead to high and persistent unit labour cost growth , higher inflationary pressure and losses in competitiveness .
Examples of such rigidities are low productivity growth due to a lack of competition in some sectors and an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices .
The main refinancing operations , the longer-term refinancing operations and structural operations ( with the exception of outright transactions ) are always executed in the form of standard tenders .
Bilateral operations through direct contact with counterparties can be applied for reverse transactions , outright transactions , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits .
Multiple rate auction ( American auction ) : an auction at which the allotment interest rate ( or price / swap point ) equals the interest rate offered in each individual bid .
( 4 ) This applies if a counterparty has a negative balance on the settlement account at the end of the day and does not fulfil the access conditions for the marginal lending facility .

29 April 2004 - Long-term interest rates for assessing convergence in the acceding countries
Today , the European Central Bank and the European Commission ( Eurostat ) have published , for the first time , statistics on long-term interest rates for the ten acceding countries that will join the European Union ( EU ) on 1 May 2004 .
At present , harmonised long-term interest rates are available for nine of the acceding countries .
These interest rates will be used to assess the degree of convergence of these countries , as required under Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community ( the Treaty ) .
The interest rates have been defined jointly by the European Central Bank , the national central banks of the acceding countries and the European Commission ( Eurostat ) .
Under Article 121 of the Treaty , the convergence of long-term interest rates is one of the criteria for assessing the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence for Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) .
Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria annexed to the Treaty states that interest rates should be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable securities .
On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , taking into account ongoing upward pressure on prices stemming mainly from energy price developments , the Governing Council concluded that the monetary policy stance still remains appropriate .
It is of the essence that the increase in current inflation rates does not translate into inflationary pressures over the medium term and to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
Across the maturity spectrum , interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms , and the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity .
Consumption should gradually recover , broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income .
At the same time , the outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks , relating mainly to oil prices , concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence .
Turning to price developments , recent increases in mainly energy prices have pushed headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2 %.
Moreover , the strengthening of monetary growth observed since mid-2004 has gained further momentum over the past few months .
Growth in the monetary aggregate M3 has been driven by its most liquid components , confirming the increasingly dominant impact of the low level of interest rates .
Furthermore , the growth of borrowing , especially mortgage loans , remains very robust .
In this context , price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely .
Domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term still remain contained in the euro area , but significant upside risks have to be taken into account .
Overall , cross-checking the information from the two pillars confirms that strong vigilance is warranted to keep inflation expectations in line with price stability .
Only by keeping medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability can monetary policy make a significant ongoing contribution towards a recovery in economic growth .
As regards fiscal policies , a number of countries have presented their 2006 budget plans .
Despite some welcome progress with fiscal consolidation , the outlook for countries in excessive deficit is a matter of great concern , as there is a risk of consolidation not proceeding and commitments for this year and next not being met .
Further delays in the correction of excessive deficits and a continued inclination to look for the most lenient way to implement the procedural steps of the revised Stability and Growth Pact risk undermining the Pact 's credibility .
This would be the most effective way to enhance the growth prospects of the euro area and to build confidence in public finances ahead of the time when the challenges of population ageing set in .
As regards structural reforms , the Governing Council stresses again the urgent need to increase the flexibility of labour and product markets in order to achieve a more dynamic and competitive European economy and to help foster the adjustment processes within the euro area .
The opportunities arising from globalisation and rapid technological change can best be captured by allowing and by speeding up structural change with a view to enhancing potential growth and employment creation .
This would also help to facilitate the necessary adjustment to the higher level of oil prices by further increasing energy efficiency and energy savings , while avoiding distortionary measures that hamper the adjustment process .
The second article analyses the financing conditions , financing developments and balance sheet positions of non-financial corporations in the euro area over the past ten years .
Further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons is provided by the monetary analysis .
This could pose risks to price stability over the medium term and warrants vigilance .
Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term .
Inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn of last year , owing mainly to strong increases in energy and food prices .
HICP inflation is now expected to remain high for a more protracted period than previously thought .
It is its strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability .
Starting with the economic analysis , real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2008 was , at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% , well above expectations .
In part , this strength reflected temporary factors , notably the unusually mild winter in many parts of Europe , which appears to have boosted construction activity .
The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound , and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances .
Against this background , investment growth in the euro area is expected to provide ongoing support to economic activity , as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained .
Looking ahead , on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities , the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain above 3 % for some time to come , before moderating only gradually in 2009 .
The euro area is therefore currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation , which is likely to be more persistent than previously anticipated .
Consistent with this view , the Eurosystem staff projections foresee average annual HICP inflation at between 3.2% and 3.6% in 2008 and between 1.8% and 3.0% in 2009 .
In the Governing Council 's view , at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon risks to the outlook for prices remain clearly on the upside and have increased further .
These risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices , as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far .
It is also a strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures .
The pricing power of firms , particularly in market segments with low competition , such as parts of the services sector , may prove stronger than currently expected .
Moreover , higher than expected wage growth may emerge , taking into account high capacity utilisation , tight labour market conditions and the risk of second-round effects .
The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations and price-setting behaviour in the euro area with particular attention .
Wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments , the still high level of unemployment in many economies , and price competitiveness positions .
Moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years .
Broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided .
While the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual M3 growth continues to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion , nonetheless , even after taking such effects into account , a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong .
Annual M1 growth has continued to moderate in recent months , reflecting higher short-term interest rates which have encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits .
The moderation in the growth of household borrowing also reflects the dampening impact of higher short-term interest rates , as well as cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area .
However , the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust .
The monetary analysis has supported the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy in the face of the ongoing financial turmoil .
From this perspective , the monetary analysis points to upside risks to price stability at longer horizons .
Moreover , a thorough assessment of the monetary counterparts suggests that , as yet , the availability of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations has not been significantly affected by the turmoil .
To sum up , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term , in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now .
The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound , and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth .
Against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices , removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit European consumers through lower prices .
The ongoing « health check » of the EU common agricultural policy is welcomed , as are the efforts to limit upward pressure on agricultural prices through biofuels policies .
A successful conclusion of the Doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in Europe and worldwide in particular .

The concept behind the glazed atrium between the two office towers is one of a « vertical city » , with interchange and connecting platforms , as well as bridges , creating the impression of urban streets and squares .
The double office tower houses the vast majority of workplaces for the ECB , as well as its internal meeting rooms .
The large conference room where the Governing Council meetings are held , as well as the offices of members of the decision-making bodies , are located on the upper floors .
Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area .
Therefore , looking ahead , acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted .
External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports .
Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum .
Consumption should also strengthen further over time , in line with developments in real disposable income , increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions .
The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term .
More fundamentally , stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability , not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters .
In this context , wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions , the still high level of unemployment in many economies , as well as productivity developments .
To sum up , in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short-term volatility in inflation rates .
Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term .

Collection and compilation of statistics
The ECB , assisted by the national central banks , collects a wide range of statistical information necessary for the fulfilment of its tasks .
Whereas direct responsibility for the pursuit of financial stability and prudential supervision has remained with the national competent authorities , the Treaty has assigned to the Eurosystem the important task of contributing to the smooth conduct of policies in these fields .
This task - which evolves in relation to market and institutional developments - comprises three main activities :
the monitoring of financial stability , which aims to identify sources of vulnerabilities and assess the degree of resilience of the financial system in the euro area .
It is the Eurosystem 's task to ensure a smooth and efficient supply of banknotes and to preserve the general public 's confidence in the currency .
Against this background , the ECB participates in meetings of international fora in which issues of relevance to the Eurosystem are addressed in order to present the Eurosystem 's views .
The Statute of the European System of Central Banks stipulates that the President of the ECB shall decide how the Eurosystem shall be represented in the field of international cooperation .

It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities .
Wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions , the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sector-specific productivity developments .
For example , increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate , M1 , in recent quarters .
Equally , the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006 , albeit at double-digit levels .
In this environment , monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring , particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments .
These reports provide the basis for the EU Council 's decision on whether the Member State concerned fulfils the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has today published on its website the report prepared by the European Court of Auditors on the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB for the financial year 2005 , together with the ECB 's reply to it .
On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , and despite renewed upward pressure on prices stemming mainly from oil market developments , the Governing Council concluded that the monetary policy stance still remains appropriate .
At the same time , strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted .
It is essential that the increase in the current inflation rate does not translate into higher underlying inflationary pressures in the euro area .
Strong vigilance is also called for in the light of ample liquidity in the euro area .
Across the maturity spectrum , interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms , and thus lend ongoing support to economic activity .
For this support to continue , it is of the essence that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
Starting with the economic analysis underlying the Governing Council 's assessment , real GDP grew at quarter-on-quarter rates of 0.4% and 0.3% in the first and second quarters of 2005 , dampened in particular by higher oil prices .
In line with the September ECB staff projections , recent survey indicators , on balance , support the view that economic growth could gradually pick up from the second half of this year .
This outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks , relating mainly to oil prices , concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence .
Temporarily , further uncertainty arose as to the economic effects of the recent hurricanes in the United States , which , in the meantime , have generally been assessed to be limited and short-term .
However , there is currently no indication that oil prices will moderate significantly in the foreseeable future .
In particular , wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and , with labour markets weak , this should continue for the time being .
The main scenario , therefore , remains one of elevated inflation rates over the short term , and with a gradual decline thereafter .
The monetary analysis provides further insight into inflation prospects over medium to longer horizons .
Money and credit have continued to grow robustly in the euro area over the past few months , with the annual rate of M3 growth now exceeding 8 %.
The strength of monetary growth has been increasingly driven primarily by the prevailing low level of interest rates .
In recent months , the short-term dynamics of M3 have gained further momentum and the growth of borrowing , in particular mortgage loans , remains very strong .
Strong monetary and credit growth , in the context of an already ample liquidity situation in the euro area , points to risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons .
To sum up , the economic analysis indicates that oil and petrol price increases , in particular , imply upward revisions to the outlook for short-term price developments .
Moreover , the monetary analysis identifies upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .
Overall , cross-checking the information from the two pillars confirms the need for strong vigilance in order to maintain inflation expectations in line with price stability .
By keeping medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability , monetary policy continues to make a significant contribution towards a recovery in economic growth .
As regards fiscal policies in the euro area , most recent information again provides a very mixed picture .
Some countries still report significant imbalances , while others maintain sound fiscal positions .
This would help to support confidence within the euro area by strengthening expectations of sustainable and growth-friendly public finances and by enhancing the credibility of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact .
As for the impact of high oil prices on public finances , consolidation of budgets must be continued .
In addition , as affirmed in the latest G7 statement , subsidies and artificial price caps that constrain the price of oil and oil products have an adverse effect on the global market and should be avoided .
Such measures are also not in the longer-run interests of the economies concerned since all economies will eventually need to adjust to the higher level of the oil price .
Unit labour cost ( ULC ) developments within the euro area play an important role in determining inflation and competitiveness patterns across the euro area countries .
In this respect , the flexibility within the euro area may well have been underestimated in the early phases of its existence .
This may be , at least partially , due to wage rigidities , such as an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices or high reservation wages determined by the level of unemployment benefits , to low labour productivity growth and to a lack of competition in some sectors .
In the context of external shocks , such as sharp increases in oil prices , there is an even greater need for increasing the resilience of euro area economies by speeding-up structural reforms .
Together with the completion of the EU internal market , such reforms would support ULC developments that are conducive to price stability and would further smooth the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area , thereby strengthening the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment .
The first article assesses the impact of economic and financial uncertainty on the euro area 's money demand , emphasising in particular the influence of that uncertainty on portfolio decisions .
At its meeting on 5 October 2006 , the Governing Council decided to increase the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points to 3.25% .
The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also increased by 25 basis points to 4.25% and 2.25% respectively .
The decision to raise the key ECB interest rates reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that the Governing Council has identified on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses .
Also after this increase , the key ECB interest rates remain at low levels , money and credit growth remain strong , and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures .
If the Governing Council 's assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed , it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation .
The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term .
Starting with the economic analysis , the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the second quarter of 2006 was confirmed at 0.9% .
Moreover , since the previous meeting of the Governing Council , on 31 August 2006 , Eurostat has revised upwards the growth data for the two preceding quarters , thereby confirming that a significant acceleration in economic expansion has taken place over the past few quarters .
On the basis of the revised data , economic activity has been growing at a quarterly rate of 0.7% on average over the last four quarters , the unemployment rate has been on a falling trend , employment growth has recovered and employment expectations overall have remained favourable .
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2006 and 2007 , the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential , with some volatility in the quarterly growth rates likely to emerge around the turn of the year .
Global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and is still robust , thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports .
Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time , in line with developments in real disposable income , as employment conditions continue to improve .
Over the longer term , risks to growth lie on balance on the downside , and relate mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices , fears of a rise in protectionist pressures , especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks , and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances .
As regards price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , annual HICP inflation fell to 1.8% in September 2006 , from 2.3% in August .
Although no detailed breakdown is available as yet , this relatively sharp decline seems to be the combined result of favourable base effects , given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago , and the recent significant fall in oil prices .
While the outlook for energy prices is uncertain , on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets , overall inflation rates are likely to increase again towards the end of the year and in early 2007 .
As a consequence , the Governing Council expects a considerable degree of short-term volatility in the annual HICP inflation rate , while the overall inflation rate will remain elevated at levels above 2 % on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007 .
The monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons .
Annual M3 growth rose again to 8.2% in August and , more generally , the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid , reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area .
In particular , loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis , remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors .
Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective , these developments remain consistent with the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion , identified by the ECB 's monetary analysis since mid-2004 .
Moreover , following several years of robust monetary growth , the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures .
As regards fiscal policy , euro area countries are now in the process of finalising their 2007 budgets and preparing their next stability programme updates .
In the current favourable economic environment , it is essential that adequate headway be made towards sound public finances , implying that budget targets for 2007 should generally be more ambitious than in previous programmes .
Countries in excessive deficit need to remain fully committed to bringing their deficits to below 3 % within the agreed deadline via adequate and credible structural consolidation .
Other countries need to make clear progress towards their medium-term objectives in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact .
In all cases , any revenue windfalls from stronger than expected growth should be used to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses .
Pro-cyclical policies should be avoided and expenditure restraint is of particular importance , also given the high spending ratios and taxes as compared with many other industrialised countries .
Experience has shown that expenditure reform is key to successful consolidation , and consolidation is essential for reducing overall public debt and for making public finances less vulnerable to the impact of ageing populations .
Fiscal consolidation is likely to be most successful when coupled with comprehensive structural reforms .
In order to support the potential economic growth of the euro area , to foster macroeconomic flexibility and dynamism , and to safeguard the future standard of living of our citizens , labour and product market reforms are urgently needed .
This will increase labour market participation and employment and strengthen innovation and the other forces driving productivity and economic growth .
The ECB will play its part by continuing to maintain price stability over the medium term .
The first article discusses the possible economic consequences and monetary policy implications of projected demographic trends in the euro area , underlining the critical need for structural reforms to better cope with the adverse effects of ageing populations on the economy .

At today 's meeting , which was held in Madrid , the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions :

The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 3.75% , with effect from 15 June 2006 .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 1.75% , with effect from 15 June 2006 .
Nevertheless , Member States with a derogation can be expected to join the mechanism .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has today published the report prepared by the European Court of Auditors on the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB for the financial year 2008 , together with the ECB 's reply to it .
Decision of the ECB of 15 May 2008 on security accreditation procedures for manufacturers of euro secure items for euro banknotes ( ECB / 2008/3 )
On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged at its meeting on 6 July 2006 .
The information that had become available since the previous meeting on 8 June confirmed that a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation had been warranted to contain upside risks to price stability .
Indeed , acting in a timely manner to contain such risks remains essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
With key ECB interest rates at still low levels in both nominal and real terms , money and credit growth dynamic , and liquidity ample by all plausible measures , monetary policy continues to be accommodative .
Therefore , if the Governing Council 's assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed , a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted .
On balance , this confirms the Governing Council 's assessment that economic growth has both regained momentum and become more broadly based and sustained in the first half of 2006 .
Investment is expected to pick up , benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions , balance sheet restructuring and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency .
Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen gradually over time , in line with developments in real disposable income , as employment conditions improve further .
This broadly favourable outlook for economic activity is also reflected in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and forecasts by international organisations and public and private sector institutions .
The risks to the outlook for economic growth appear to be balanced over the shorter term , while in the longer term downside risks prevail , relating mainly to potential further oil price rises , a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and potential pressures for increased protectionism .
With respect to price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in June 2006 , compared with the same rate in May and 2.4% in April .
During the second half of 2006 , and on average in 2007 , inflation rates are likely to remain above 2 %, the precise levels depending on future energy price developments .
This assessment is supported by the Eurosystem staff projections and available public and private sector forecasts .
Against this background , and also in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment , it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities .
Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices , a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently expected , additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes and , more fundamentally , stronger than expected wage and price developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases .
Monetary developments , therefore , require enhanced monitoring , particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets .
In order to translate the opportunities offered by globalisation -- in terms of higher living standards -- into achievements , the euro area would greatly benefit from more flexible labour and product markets .
It would also gain from a more favourable business environment and a fully-fledged internal market -- including in the services sector -- that foster innovation , investment and the creation of new firms .
At its meeting on 7 February 2008 , the Governing Council of the ECB decided , on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
This decision reflects the Governing Council 's assessment that risks to price stability over the medium term are on the upside , in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth .
The current short-term upward pressure on inflation must not spill over to the medium term .
The firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium and long term is of the highest priority to the Governing Council , reflecting its mandate .
Against this background , the Governing Council remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term .
As the reappraisal of risk in financial markets continues , there remains unusually high uncertainty about its overall impact on the real economy .
While the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound , incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside .
The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks .
Starting with the economic analysis , the latest information on economic activity around the turn of the year points to a more moderate pace of growth in the euro area than the quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% observed in the third quarter of 2007 .
This assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which , while having declined over the past few months , overall remain consistent with ongoing growth .
Looking ahead , while the slowdown in the economies of some of the euro area 's major trading partners is likely to have an impact on euro area real GDP growth in 2008 , both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing growth .
This assessment is broadly in line with available forecasts from private and public-sector sources .
As a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation , the number of people employed and labour force participation have increased significantly .
Consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion , in line with real disposable income , and investment growth should provide ongoing support .
That said , uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth is unusually high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity have been confirmed to lie on the downside .
Risks relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments on financing conditions and economic sentiment , with negative effects on world and euro area growth .
Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises , concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances .
In the view of the Governing Council , this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens .
The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention .
Finally , further rises in oil and agricultural prices , continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months , as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far pose upside risks to the inflation outlook .
Annual M3 growth , although declining somewhat in December , remained very vigorous at 11.5% , whereas M1 growth continues to moderate , reflecting the dampening impact of higher interest rates .
Broad money dynamics in recent quarters are likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors , notably the flattening of the yield curve , which may have supported some substitution into monetary assets .
Overall , taking these special factors into account , a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong .
This conclusion is supported by the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector , which grew at an annual rate of 11.1% in December .
Although the growth of household borrowing has moderated further over the past few quarters , reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area , the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust .
Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations was 14.4% higher at the end of December 2007 than a year earlier .
For the time being , there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates .
Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks » balance sheets , financing conditions and money and credit growth .
To sum up , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term , in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area .
The impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on the real economy is still surrounded by unusually high uncertainty .
Reflecting its mandate , such anchoring is of the highest priority to the Governing Council .
Allowing the free operation of automatic stabilisers in countries with strong fiscal positions and safeguarding the long-term sustainability of public finances are the best contributions that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability .
Countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with consolidation , in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact .
There is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the Pact , thereby undermining its credibility .
Structural reforms help economies to adjust to adverse shocks , foster productivity growth and increase employment and competition , thereby also helping to reduce inflationary pressures .
These securities generally entitle the holders to a share in the profits of corporations or quasi-corporations and to a share in their own funds in the event of liquidation .
Guideline of the ECB of 26 August 2008 amending Guideline ECB / 2002/7 on the statistical reporting requirements of the ECB in the field of quarterly financial accounts ( ECB / 2008/6 )
In producing this report , the ECB fulfils the requirement of Article 122 ( 2 ) in conjunction with Article 121 ( 1 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community to report to the Council of the European Union ( EU Council ) at least once every two years or at the request of a Member State with a derogation « on the progress made in the fulfilment by the Member States of their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union » .
On 3 May 2005 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies ( hereinafter the « proposed regulation ') .
The proposed regulation is based on Article 99 ( 5 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
Although this provision does not explicitly envisage consultation of the ECB , the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies are relevant to the European System of Central Banks » primary objective of maintaining price stability .
Therefore , the ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the first indent of Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty .
Compliance with these principles will also facilitate transparency and equal treatment in the implementation of the framework .
While the ECB does not see a need to express an opinion on the specific provisions of the proposed regulation , it endorses the aim of improving the surveillance and coordination of economic policies so as to achieve and maintain medium-term objectives that ensure the sustainability of public finances .
A rigorous and consistent implementation of the surveillance procedures would be conducive to prudent fiscal policies .
The adoption of the proposal will lead to the repeal of existing legislation .
In December 2004 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) approved the « Framework for the detection of counterfeits and fitness sorting of euro banknotes by credit institutions and other professional cash handlers » ( hereinafter the « BRF ") .
The following banknote handling equipment is not covered by this test procedure :
The tests assess a machine type 's ability to recognise genuine banknotes ( pre-test ) , distinguish between genuine euro banknotes and counterfeits ( counterfeit detection test ) and , if applicable , to sort banknotes according to their fitness for use in circulation ( fitness test ) .
In addition , for customer-operated machines , the proper functioning of the tracing system is verified ( tracing system test ) .
The tests are conducted with a specific collection of genuine and counterfeit euro banknotes as set out below .
As new counterfeits exhibiting properties differing from those of the banknotes used in the test may emerge at any time , it is stressed that the test results published on this website reflect merely the ability of the tested machine type to detect those counterfeits contained in the test deck and used for testing on the day of the test , as indicated in the test results .
The Eurosystem therefore urges manufacturers and entities using the machine types to follow developments in the field of counterfeiting and regularly update the machine types if necessary to ensure that newly occurring counterfeits can also be reliably detected .
In addition to the initial test verifying the BRF-compliance of a machine type ( verification tests ) , the Eurosystem 's common test procedure provides for regular testing of the machine type ( annual tests ) as well as additional testing upon invitation on an ad hoc basis ( re-tests ) .
Moreover , any update of a machine type which involves its tested functions requires its submission to a test according to the common test procedure .
All tests follow the same procedures and are carried out with the machine manufacturers .
Only the types of machine that have passed a test are listed on this web page .
In addition to a tested machine type , one or more further machine ( s ) of the same type of that manufacturer may be listed in brackets (" further machines ") that are not tested by a Eurosystem NCB , but are published on this ECB webpage on the basis of a written guarantee by its manufacturer that they have the same hardware and software and thus the same performance with respect to the core functionalities defined in the BRF as the tested machine type .
The banknotes are fed into the machine type in all orientations and feeding orientations claimed by the manufacturer to be supported by the machine type .
The test is passed if at least 90 % of the banknotes tested are sorted as genuine and fit .
The counterfeit test is conducted with a standardised test deck , which is composed of counterfeits found in circulation and of artificially created documents that have been manufactured by the Eurosystem to imitate certain properties of euro banknotes .
Additionally , NCBs may use recent national counterfeits to adequately reflect the very latest counterfeit situation .
The Eurosystem test procedure and procedure on updating the standardised test deck ensure that the use of recent national counterfeits would not lead to the existence of different national test standards .
Samples of counterfeits of all denominations which the manufacturer applying for the test affirms can be handled by the machine type are tested in all orientations that are claimed to be supported by the machine type .
For staff-operated machines , the test is passed if all counterfeits and other documents contained in the test deck that are not genuine euro banknotes are detected and sorted out .
Customer-operated machines pass the test if none of the counterfeits and other documents is accepted as a genuine banknote and additionally if not less than 90 % of the counterfeits of the test deck are retained either as category 2 banknotes ( i.e. banknotes suspected to be counterfeits ) or as category 3 banknotes ( i.e. not clearly authenticated banknotes ) .
The artificially created other documents imitating certain properties of euro banknotes included in the test deck would , however , not be taken into account for the retention rate .
The fitness test is conducted with a test set of genuine euro banknotes exhibiting artificially created defects similar to those caused by use in circulation .
The unfit test banknotes are fed into the machine type in all orientations that the manufacturer applying for the test claims to be supported by the machine type .
The SEPA project represents the next major step towards closer European integration .
SEPA will allow customers to make non-cash euro payments to any beneficiary located anywhere in the euro area using a single bank account and a single set of payment instruments .
The EPC has defined a framework that clarifies the rules and procedures to be followed by infrastructure providers ( i.e. ACHs , card scheme processors and other processors that handle , transfer and exchange payment-related information for financial institutions ) .
The SEPA project will have a major impact on all stakeholders , creating opportunities as well as challenges .
Regulation No 2560/2001 was introduced to make charges for comparable domestic and cross-border payments the same .
C O M P O N E N T S O F S E PA
Value-added services + Electronic use only + Common payment instruments , infrastructures , standards and legal basis
The current national instruments will gradually be replaced by SEPA instruments based on these common SEPA schemes and frameworks .
The framework also contains a classification of different infrastructure types , ranging from PEACHs and inter-group arrangements to purely bilateral arrangements .
Another aim is to ensure full transparency in terms of infrastructure providers » services and prices .
Settlement is the transfer of funds between the payer and the payee ( and between the payer 's bank and the payee 's bank ) .

Unofficial consolidated version of the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing Council
On 10 September 2009 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 2006/48 / EC and 2006/49 / EC as regards capital requirements for the trading book and for re-securitisations , and the supervisory review of remuneration policies ( 1 ) ( here ­ inafter the « proposed directive ') .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the first indent of Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and on Article 105 ( 5 ) of the Treaty , as the proposed directive concerns one of the tasks of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) , namely to contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the stability of the financial system .
The ECB welcomes the proposed directive as regards capital requirements for bank trading books and for re-securitisations , which are broadly consistent with the approach recently developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( 2 ) .
The ECB is of the view that there is the need to further align the requirements of the proposed directive to the revised Basel II market risk framework .
In particular , the ECB suggests introducing in Annex II point ( 1 ) of the proposed directive an exemption for corre ­ lation trading activities from the requirement that all securitisation exposures in the trading book receive the standardised specific risk treatment .
( 2 ) See the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 's « Revisions to the Basel II market risk framework » , « Guidelines for computing capital for incremental risk in the trading book » , and « Enhancements to the Basel II framework » , dated 13 July 2009 , available on the Bank for International Settlements » website at http://www.bis.org
The ECB also welcomes the introduction of remuneration provisions in Annex I to the proposed directive , which are in line with the commitment of the G20 leaders to implement international compensation standards aimed at ending practices that lead to excessive risk-taking ( 1 ) .
Moreover , the ECB supports the application of the provisions for remuneration policies at the group level , to ensure consistent treatment of risk-taking employees in all jurisdictions where EU banks operate .
Finally , the ECB highlights that when introducing international standards that primarily address significant financial institutions into Community law , which applies to all credit institutions ( including small ones ) , the proportionality principle , as laid down in the Treaty , should be applied appropriately .
As a consequence , the ECB suggests deleting the proposed Article 122b .
( c ) the management body ( supervisory function ) of the credit institution establishes and reviews the general principles of the remuneration policy and is responsible for its implementation ;
( d ) the implementation of the remuneration policy is , at least annually , subject to central and inde ­ pendent internal review for compliance with policies and procedures for remuneration defined by the management body ( supervisory function ) ;
( e ) where remuneration is performance related , the total amount of remuneration is based on a combi ­ nation of the assessment of the performance of the individual and of the business unit concerned and of the overall results of the credit institution ;
( h ) the measurement of performance used to calculate bonuses or bonus pools includes an adjustment for current and future risks and takes into account the cost of the capital and the liquidity required ;
( h ) guaranteed variable remuneration may only occur in exceptional cases in the context of hiring new staff and is limited to the first year , taking due account of prudent risk management policies ;
( i ) payment of the major part of a significant bonus is deferred for an appropriate period and is linked to the future performance of the firm .'
( j ) payment of the total variable remuneration does not limit the ability of the credit insti ­ tution to strengthen its capital base ;
Finally , the ECB proposes the introduction of new principles reflecting the agreement of the G20 leaders reached at the Pittsburgh Summit on 24-25 September 2009 .
In particular , the G20 leaders fully endorsed the implementation standards of the Financial Stability Board aimed at aligning compensation with long-term value creation , not excessive risk-taking ( see footnote 3 above ) .
For the purposes of points 10b ( a ) and 10b ( b ) , the results of the institution 's own calculation shall be scaled up by a multiplication factor ( mc +) of at least 3 and a multiplication factor ( ms ) of at least 3 .'
Explanation : The ECB supports the alignment of the proposed directive with the relevant Basel text ( i.e. Revisions to the Basel II market risk framework ) that provides for two different multipliers for current and stressed value-at-risk .

To achieve this goal , it closely follows economic developments in the euro area and seeks to influence the state of the economy through its decision-making .
Thus , the Governing Council , the Executive Board and the General Council of the ECB each take all the decisions necessary to enable the Eurosystem and the ESCB to carry out their respective tasks .
They also collect statistics for the ECB , collaborate with the ECB on translation and the production of publications and contribute to economic analysis and research .
By contrast , the ECB carries out few operations while it oversees all of them , in order to ensure that the operations of the Eurosystem are performed consistently by the euro area NCBs .
Interest rates shall be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable securities , taking into account differences in national definitions » .

Between the spring and autumn of 2008 , preliminary construction work was carried out on the site of the former Grossmarkthalle and the new premises of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to prepare the ground for the main construction works .
Before it could hand over the site to the ECB , the City of Frankfurt am Main was responsible for clearing the site and preparing it for the handover .
However , stockpiling goods is not an efficient investment decision , and therefore hinders economic growth .
Tax and welfare systems can create perverse incentives that distort economic behaviour .
Price stability eliminates the real economic costs entailed when inflation exacerbates the distortionary impact of tax and social security systems .
Similarly , changes in credit extended to the private sector can be informative about financial conditions and , through the monetary financial institutions ( MFI ) balance sheet , can provide additional information about money .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has today published on its website the report prepared by the European Court of Auditors on the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB for the financial year 2003 , together with the ECB 's reply to it .

On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council has concluded that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate , given the current outlook for inflation rates over the medium term .
The prevailing exceptionally low level of both nominal and real interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum provides considerable support to economic activity in the euro area .
At present , although upside risks to price stability exist , the Governing Council continues to see no significant evidence of a build-up in underlying inflationary pressures in the euro area .
However , not least in view of the risk of second-round effects from ongoing oil price increases , it continues to monitor the development of inflation expectations very closely .
At present , particular vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted .
On the domestic side , investment should benefit from very favourable financing conditions , the robust growth of corporate earnings and ongoing improvements in corporate efficiency .
Recent forecasts from international and private sector organisations give a similar picture .
In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections , the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been revised downwards slightly , reflecting both the downward revision of growth data for the first quarter of this year and the effects of higher oil prices .
On balance , risks to the economic growth projections continue to lie on the downside , and relate to higher oil prices , low consumer confidence and concerns about global imbalances .
Turning to price developments , annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in August according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , compared with 2.2% in July .
Risks to this new baseline inflation scenario are on the upside and relate to potential further rises in oil prices , administered prices and indirect taxes .
More fundamentally , the main risks to the inflation outlook stem from potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour triggered by ongoing oil price rises .
Low interest rates are also fuelling credit expansion , with the strengthening of the demand for loans broadly based across the private sector .
The liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample by all plausible measures , indicating risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons .
To sum up , recent oil price developments have pushed up the inflation projections for the year ahead , while medium-term domestic inflationary pressures still remain contained in the euro area .
However , the balance of risks to the baseline inflation scenario is tilted to the upside .
Cross-checking the economic analysis with the monetary analysis confirms the need for particular vigilance in order to keep medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
A rigorous implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact would reinforce the credibility of reform plans and boost expectations of a sound fiscal and growth situation .
The programme focuses on enhancing knowledge and innovation in order to strengthen growth , on making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work , and on creating more and better jobs .
It includes , for example , measures to further open EU markets and to simplify the regulatory framework within which business operates .
The Community Lisbon Programme will be complemented by the introduction of national action plans for growth and jobs , which the Member States will present this autumn .
In August 2007 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) will launch an international public tender for a general contractor to construct its new premises .
The contract notice will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union , as well as on the ECB 's website .
The ECB will build its new premises on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of Frankfurt am Main , Germany , based on the design of the Viennese architectural office COOP HIMMELB ( L ) AU .
The new premises will include a high-rise building approximately 180 metres tall , the former wholesale market hall ( Großmarkthalle ) , other secondary buildings and a landscaped site .
The main construction work will commence in October 2008 , with finalisation scheduled for before the end of 2011 .
The work and services to be provided by the general contractor will mainly consist of construction work and fitting-out , but will also include planning and management services .
Further information on the upcoming tender for the construction of the new ECB premises can be obtained at the following internet addresses : http://ted.europa.eu ( search for : T070 ) , www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/jobsproc/proc/tenders , www.new-ecb-premises.com .

Participation pursuant to these Conditions shall not create a contractual relationship between participants and the SSP-providing CBs when the latter act in that capacity .
Settlement of payment orders in the queue ( 1 ) The treatment of payment orders placed in queues depends on the priority class to which it was designated by the instructing participant .
If the outcome of these calculations and checks is positive for each relevant PM account , the [ insert name of CB ] and other CBs involved shall settle all payments simultaneously on the PM accounts of the TARGET2 participants concerned .
In addition , the ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Articles 105 ( 2 ) and 106 ( 1 ) of the Treaty and Articles 16 to 18 and 21 to 23 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , as the proposed directive contains provisions which have implications for certain ESCB tasks .
The result of the revision of the FATF 's Forty Recommendations , which was completed in June 2003 , is an enhanced and more comprehensive framework of international standards for safeguarding the integrity of the financial system .
In particular , the scope of application of the Forty Recommendations was extended from the field of money laundering to also cover terrorist financing .
Against this backdrop , the proposed directive will provide the single market with an enhanced and consistent legal framework for combating money laundering and terrorist financing .
The ECB also welcomes the proposed directive as it facilitates the coordinated implementation and application of the FATF 's Forty Recommendations among Member States , thereby contributing to the convergence of practices in this field .
As noted in recital 2 of the proposed directive , Community action in this area is necessary « in order to avoid Member States » adopting measures to protect their financial systems which could be inconsistent with the functioning of the internal market » .
( 1 ) Implementing Special Recommendation VII ( on wire transfers ) of the FATF 's Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing .
This link stems from the fact that loss directly ( 2 ) resulting from inadequate customer due diligence falls within the scope of operational risk , defined in Article 4 of the proposed recast Consolidated Banking Directive to include the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems .
Therefore the management of operational risk , as required in Annex V , point 11 of the proposed recast Consolidated Banking Directive also encompasses the policies and procedures required under Articles 7 and 30 of the proposed directive .
More generally , pursuant to Article 22 of the proposed recast Consolidated Banking Directive , requirements must be imposed on banks to have processes to manage all material actual or future risks , which would include reputational risk resulting from inadequate customer due diligence .
The ECB notes that Article 11 ( 1 ) of the proposed directive sets out enhanced customer due diligence requirements in respect of , inter alia , « cross-frontier correspondent banking relationships with credit institutions from other Member States or third countries » .
This provision seeks to implement Recommendation 7 of the FATF 's Forty Recommendations , which covers cross-frontier correspondent banking relationships .
However , the wording of Article 11 ( 1 ) of the proposed directive does not appear to have taken into account the specific EU system of mutual recognition , as set out in the Consolidated Banking Directive ( 3 ) .
It is questionable whether correspondent banking relationships between credit institutions in two different Member States should , as contemplated by the proposed directive , be regarded as high-risk situations requiring an assessment of inter alia the « quality of supervision » of a credit institution in another Member State or the « reputation » of a credit institution authorised by another Member State .
Since correspondent banking relationships with central banks , monetary authorities and international financial institutions are not generally associated with a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing , with the exception of institutions from countries on the FATF 's list of non-cooperative countries and territories , the ECB recommends incorporation of a similar exemption in the proposed directive 's enhanced customer due diligence requirements for cross-frontier correspondent banking relationships .
In practice central banks represent a very low risk of money laundering and an explicit reference to central banks would increase legal clarity .
As is the case with the current Money Laundering Directive , the proposed directive applies to credit and financial institutions ( Article 2 ( 1 )) .
It is unclear whether central banks themselves fall within the scope of the proposed directive .
For reasons of legal clarity , the ECB would welcome it if Article 2 of the proposed directive were amended by adding a separate paragraph according to which central banks shall assess the extent to which they represent a risk of being used for money laundering and , where there is a material risk of money laundering occurring , shall take appropriate measures to ensure that they comply with the objectives of the proposed directive .
This is in line with the requirements of the current Money Laundering Directive , as implemented in the national laws of the Member States .

A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing .
The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term , as money and credit growth continues to slow down .
Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced .
On the downside , concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector , renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices , the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances .
Looking further ahead , inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon , with overall price , cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere .
In this context , it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
The Governing Council will continue its enhanced credit support to the banking system , while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long .
In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term , the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary .
An appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should also play an important role .
Sound balance sheets , effective risk management , and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks » resilience to shocks , thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability .
Banknote research and development -- cooperation opportunities with the ECB
Turning to the economic analysis , after a period of sharp decline , euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009 .
Ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports , together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system , should continue to support the euro area economy .
However , the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects .
Looking further ahead , in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall , benefiting from low domestic price pressures .
A lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to developments in economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle .
The challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up .
Where necessary , to address this challenge , banks should retain earnings , turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation .
In order to support the process of fiscal consolidation , to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth , the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential .
Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness .
Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies .
This coin shows a modern sea-going tanker , reflecting the innovative spirit of Greek shipping .
The proposal has no implication for the Community budget .
The institutions shall ensure that euro coins , which they have received and which they intend to put back into circulation , are submitted to authentication .
A handling fee of 5 % of the face value of the submitted euro coins unfit for circulation shall be withheld from the reimbursement or the replacement of these euro coins .
Transport and related costs shall be borne by the submitting legal or natural person .
The cash changeover in 2002 was a significant event in Europe 's history and a major technical achievement .
On 1 January that year euro banknotes and coins were introduced in 12 countries with a total of population of 308 million .
After a dual circulation period , which in some countries lasted for up to two months and when payments could be made in euro cash or the national currency , the euro became the sole legal tender in the euro area on 1 March 2002 .
By that date , more than 6 billion banknotes and close to 30 billion national coins had been withdrawn .
The ECB coordinated and monitored the banknote production at 15 sites , involving some 40 different raw material suppliers .
A common quality management system ensured an identical standard for all banknotes .
Although the individual countries were ( and are ) responsible for euro coins , the ECB acted as a neutral assessor of coin quality to make sure that they could be used in vending machines throughout the euro area .
The production of euro banknotes started in July 1999 and involved 15 banknote printing works located across the European Union .
Each national central bank was responsible for deciding where to print the initial supply of banknotes required in its respective country and each Member State was responsible for its own coin requirements .
5 August 2004 - Review of the Eurosystem 's collateral framework : second step towards a single list
In June 2003 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) launched a public consultation to gather the views of market participants on measures to improve the collateral framework of the Eurosystem .
Following the positive response to this initiative , the Governing Council of the ECB approved the gradual introduction of a « Single List » in the collateral framework of the Eurosystem ( see Press Release of 10 May 2004 ) to replace the current two-tier system of eligible collateral .
Finally , the Governing Council has also decided that equities , which are currently eligible as tier two collateral in Spain , the Netherlands and Portugal , shall not be included in the Single List .
Preliminary construction work for the new premises of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) was carried out on the Grossmarkthalle site during the summer of 2008 .
The main construction works are set to commence in spring 2010 , starting with the structural works followed by the installation of the facade and the fit-out including building services .
There are two series of coins in circulation .
Against this background , the Governing Council expects price stability to be maintained over the medium term , thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households .
At the same time , the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead .
Turning to structural reforms , in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of the euro area economies .

In yesterday 's meeting , the Governing Council decided to increase the allotment amount for each of the longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted in 2007 from EUR 40 billion to EUR 50 billion .
The liquidity needs of the euro area banking system have grown strongly in recent years and are expected to increase further in the year 2007 .
13 February 2004 - International jury chooses the three prizewinning designs in the architectural competition for the ECB 's new premises
1st prize : Coop Himmelb ( l ) au , Vienna , Austria
This concept has an intelligent combination of old and new in a sculptural form .
The ensemble is formed from three basic elements : the Grossmarkthalle , a « groundscraper » and polygonal twin towers .
2nd prize : ASP Schweger Assoziierte , Berlin , Germany
This innovative concept will create an exhilarating effect with the vertical buildings connected through an entrance plaza and the elevated plane .
The concept integrates well with the neighbourhood , incorporating many requirements of the functional programme .
The competition was launched in November 2002 ( see the ECB 's Press Release of 26 November 2002 ) as a restricted project competition in two phases preceded by the pre-selection of 80 qualified applicants ( see the ECB 's Press Release of 7 April 2003 ) and possibly followed by an optional revision phase .
By 7 July 2003 , which was the deadline for the first phase , 71 of the 80 candidates had submitted initial outline concepts .
compliance with the main features of the functional and spatial programme ;
feasible energy / environmental concept and compliance with the main features of the ECB 's technical requirements ;
compliance with the relevant regulations , particularly those in the field of building law and environmental law .
In a revision phase to follow , the Governing Council of the ECB will invite one or more prizewinners to review their design proposals , and a final design will be agreed on in cooperation with the ECB and the City of Frankfurt .
Cleaning a printing plate at the Banque de France printing works in Chamalières
The Governing Council usually meets twice a month at the Eurotower in Frankfurt am Main , Germany .
At its first meeting each month , the Governing Council assesses economic and monetary developments and takes its monthly monetary policy decision .
At its second meeting , the Council discusses mainly issues related to other tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem .
While the minutes of the meetings are not published , the monetary policy decision is explained in detail at a press conference held shortly after the first meeting each month .
As euro banknotes are products for everyday use , they were compared with two other everyday products and services : driving a private car and lighting a 60W bulb .
The assessment concluded that the environmental impact of euro banknotes during their complete life cycle is equivalent to each European citizen driving a car one kilometer or leaving a 60W light bulb switched on for half a day .
The assessment was based on process data collected from a total of 31 suppliers in the euro banknote supply chain , on specific data on raw materials used and literature data on standard processes , such as the production of electricity or transport - mostly taken from the Ecoinvent 2000 database .
Already before their launch in January 2002 , euro banknotes were tested for possible risks related to acute oral toxicity , dermal irritation and genotoxicity .
In the absence of any specific regulation for banknotes , the tests were carried out in accordance with the ISO 10993-Part 3 standard .
The results confirmed that euro banknotes do not cause any of the above-mentioned hazards .
In addition , the ECB assessed general health and safety risks related to the manufacturing and use of euro banknotes .
Extensive laboratory analyses on representative samples showed that there was no evidence of the presence of many dangerous substances in euro banknotes , or that they have been detected at a very low concentration beyond the legal limits , such as those applicable to foodstuffs or day-to-day products in contact with the human body .
Since 2001 the Eurosystem has been approached on a variety of substances ( see below for details ) .
In February 2002 the German magazine « Öko-Test » published an article on the presence of organotin compounds in euro banknotes , with the following concentrations :
Press publications in 2003 stated that euro banknotes were printed on paper containing a high concentration of genetically modified cotton fibres .
The euro banknotes are printed on paper made of 100 % cellulose .
The cotton fibres used for banknotes are the same as those used for the production of textiles for clothing .
However , the production process for euro banknote paper involves several chemical and physical treatments which remove the proteins affected by the genetic modification .
One national central bank of the Eurosystem was contacted in 2003 about a possible allergic reaction to colophony : a substance allegedly present in euro banknotes .
Colophony is a substance commonly used for improving the printing characteristics of stationery and printing paper .
Subsequent laboratory tests indicated a maximum concentration of p-phenylenediamine in euro banknotes of 0.182 mg / kg , that is , 1/300 , 000 of the maximum concentration permitted under EU legislation applicable to cosmetics .
In 2002 the ECB was contacted regarding a possible allergic reaction to nickel sulphate present in euro banknotes .
Both systems should be fully implemented at production sites by 2010 .
97 foundation piles and geothermic devices were inserted into the ground to a maximum depth of 37 m during this phase of the construction works , which was completed in October 2008 .
Pipes forming part of the water circuit are attached to the pile cage and can be connected to the heating pumps in the heating centre .
Stage Two started with the establishment of the European Monetary Institute ( EMI ) , the predecessor of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , on 1 January 1994 .
Stage Two was dedicated to technical preparations for the creation of the single currency , enforcement of fiscal discipline and enhanced convergence of the economic and monetary policies of the EU Member States .
The ECB was established in June 1998 , giving it half a year to implement the preparatory work of the EMI .
This was preceded by the EU Council meeting , in the composition of the Heads of State or Government , which in May 1998 confirmed that 11 of the 15 EU Member States at that time - Belgium , Germany , Ireland , Spain , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal and Finland - had fulfilled the criteria for the adoption of the single currency .
The first changeover to the euro was completed on 1 January 2002 with the introduction of euro banknotes and coins .
For details about the three stages of EMU , see www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/history/emu .
This decision reflects the fact that the Governing Council 's assessment of price stability over the medium term has not changed .
While short-term HICP inflation rates remain subject to certain volatilities , particularly in relation to oil prices , there is no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area .
Looking ahead , the conditions remain in place for economic growth to pick up and become more self-sustained in the course of the year .
Global growth remains solid , providing a favourable environment for euro area exports .
High and volatile oil prices and persistent global imbalances pose downside risks to growth .
On the domestic side , reducing uncertainties associated with the extent and pace of fiscal and structural reforms would support consumption , as such uncertainties seem to be affecting private sector expectations of future real disposable income growth .
Turning to consumer prices , annual HICP inflation stood at 2.4% in December , up from 2.2% in November .
Data for January are not yet available , but there are indications of a decline from December 's inflation rate .
Over the coming months , volatility in annual inflation rates is likely to persist , reflecting in particular oil price developments .
Looking further ahead , on the basis of the information available so far , HICP inflation is expected to fall below 2 % in the course of 2005 , provided no further adverse shocks occur .
At the current juncture , the evidence does not suggest that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area .
Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and , in the context of ongoing moderate economic growth and weak labour markets , this trend should continue in the future .
However , several upside risks to price stability need to be taken into account .
Concerns relate in particular to future oil price developments and , more generally , to the potential risk of second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy .
In addition , developments in indirect taxes and administered prices need to be monitored closely .
As a result of the persistently strong growth in M3 over the past few years , there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth .
The very low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit .
Growth in loans to non-financial corporations has picked up further in recent months .
Moreover , demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust , contributing to strong house price dynamics in several parts of the euro area .
The combination of ample liquidity and strong credit growth could , in some parts of the euro area , become a source of unsustainable price increases in property markets .
It is important that higher inflation in the short term does not become entrenched in long-term inflation expectations and wage and price-setting behaviour .
It is essential that Member States comply with their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact in the implementation of 2005 budgets and in the setting of medium-term objectives .
Where relevant , this implies a correction of excessive deficits this year and determined progress towards budgetary positions which are close to balance or in surplus .
Such measures should prevent a repeat of past outcomes , when insufficient adjustments were made .
In light of the need to prepare for population ageing , fiscal strategies should also be part of a comprehensive reform strategy aimed at raising Europe 's growth potential .
Discussions on the European fiscal framework now need to be brought to a convincing conclusion .
It would therefore be counterproductive to change the Regulations , dilute the 3 % deficit limit or weaken the excessive deficit procedure .
The fiscal framework enshrined in the Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of Economic and Monetary Union and thus of central importance for the cohesion of Monetary Union itself .
It is important to avoid any doubts about the effectiveness of the surveillance process and the soundness of the fiscal policies of the single currency area in the long run , as such doubts would ultimately lead to higher risk premia and higher real interest rates in the euro area .
Regarding structural reforms , the ECOFIN Council has recently endorsed the Annual Report on Structural Reforms 2005 , prepared by the Economic Policy Committee .
Closing the existing implementation gap is essential in order to reap the benefits of reforms , in terms of both a higher growth potential in the medium term and improved consumer and business confidence in the short run .
The first article reviews conceptual issues surrounding market discipline for banks and describes to what extent market discipline could complement supervisory activities .
The second article describes the initial experience with recent changes to the Eurosystem 's operational framework for monetary policy implementation .

At its meeting on 8 November 2007 , the Governing Council of the ECB decided , on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
The information that has become available since the previous meeting of the Governing Council , on 4 October , has fully confirmed that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks .
Against this background , and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area , the ECB 's monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability , as required by its mandate .
The economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound and support a favourable medium-term outlook for economic activity .
However , the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets has led to continued uncertainty .
This warrants a thorough examination of additional information before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of the ECB 's medium term-oriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability .
Accordingly , the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments .
This will favour an environment conducive to sustained economic growth , well-functioning markets and continued job creation .
As regards the financial markets , the Governing Council will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come .
On the basis of the available data , it appears that the sustained economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the third quarter , as reflected in the data for industrial production and retail sales that have been released since the meeting of the Governing Council in early October .
While financial market volatility seems to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in the past few months , these indicators generally remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth .
Overall , the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound , including in particular sustained corporate earnings and profitability , robust employment growth and falling unemployment to levels not seen for 25 years .
These risks include the possibility of persistently high oil and agricultural prices , continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months , as well as unanticipated increases in administered prices and indirect taxes .
Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorter-term dynamics on the other .
A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important , given recent financial market developments , since financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby affect monetary developments .
Monetary and credit data can therefore offer an important insight into how financial institutions , households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility and heightened uncertainty .
Indeed , previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets .
For the time being , however , there is little evidence that such shifts have influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates since the onset of financial market volatility in early August , although specific balance sheet items , such as holdings of money market fund shares / units , may have been strongly affected .
The rate of growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months , tentatively suggesting that there is no impairment in credit supply .
However , it cannot be excluded that the strong loan flows partly reflect the re-intermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets given illiquidity in some segments of the asset-backed securities markets .
Further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets , financing conditions and money and credit growth .
To sum up , a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has fully confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term , with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area , and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area .
At the same time , given the continued uncertainty , additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn .
Consequently , the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments .
The ECB 's monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability , as required by its mandate .
By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of its assessment , the Governing Council will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability , which is all the more important in the current context .
With regard to structural reforms , the Governing Council stresses that a key effect of well-designed structural reforms is a sustainable improvement in the employment and income situation of workers and households .
Reforms which increase the incentives for firms and individuals to invest in human capital tend to enhance overall labour demand and productivity .
Reducing non-wage labour costs would also enhance employment and the net income levels of workers .
Moreover , labour market regulations should not discourage firms from offering jobs , or workers from accepting them .
It is encouraging to see that past labour market reforms have contributed to job creation and reduced unemployment .
It is important that governments continue in this direction and do not reverse past reforms just at the point when they are starting to bear fruit .
EU enlargement and Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU )
Which countries have joined the EU since the ECB was established in 1998 ?
Will the new Member States automatically adopt the euro after joining the EU ?
When are the new Member States expected to adopt the euro ?
When will the new EU members join the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM II ) and under what conditions ?
What will be the role of the ECB when the central parity rates of the new Member States » currencies vis-à-vis the euro in ERM II are fixed ?
How does the size of the economies of the 12 newest Member States compare with the size of the euro area ?
What are the economic advantages of euro area enlargement ?
Does the ECB have any say in the process of EMU enlargement ?
the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to GDP at market prices , which should not exceed 3 %,
the ratio of government debt to GDP at market prices , which should not exceed 60 %.
However , the assessment of compliance with the fiscal discipline requirement will also take into account other factors , such as past progress in reducing budgetary imbalances and / or the existence of exceptional and temporary factors contributing to such imbalances .
At the same time , Member States with government debt ratios to GDP in excess of 60 % are expected to bring them down towards the reference level at a satisfactory pace .
« the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , for at least two years , without devaluing against the currency of any other Member State » .
When assessing compliance with this criterion , the emphasis is placed on the exchange rate being close to its central rate against the euro , while also considering factors that may have led to an exchange rate appreciation .
This reflects the fact that , in August 1993 , the fluctuation margins of the ERM were widened from ± 2.25 to ± 15 %, making the meaning of « the normal fluctuation margins of the ERM » less clear .
The ERM II Resolution states that « participation in the exchange rate mechanism will be voluntary for the Member States outside the euro area .
There are no specific entry pre-conditions , but a common accord on the central rate and the fluctuation band needs to be reached ( see question 14 ) .
In accordance with the Resolution of the Amsterdam European Council of 16 June 1997 , decisions on central rates in ERM II are taken by mutual agreement of the Finance Ministers of the euro area countries , the ECB and the Finance Ministers and central bank Governors of the non-euro area countries participating in the new mechanism , following a common procedure involving the European Commission , and after consultation of the Economic and Financial Committee .
The Finance Ministers and Governors of the central banks of the Member States not participating in ERM II take part but do not have the right to vote in the procedure .
In 2005 , the nominal GDP of the newest Member States ( adjusted to include Bulgaria and Romania ) was Euros 654 billion , or around 8 % of the euro area 's GDP of Euros 7,974 billion .
The euro is a public good that brings many benefits to the participating countries .
It eliminates exchange rate risks between countries that adopt it , thereby lowering interest rates , and allows countries to enjoy the benefits of price stability , which is the primary objective of the ECB .
It also paves the way for a deep , liquid and integrated capital market among countries that adopt it .
Euro area enlargement means that a larger number of EU Member States can enjoy these benefits .
Furthermore , some of the economic advantages of monetary union , such as the elimination of exchange rate uncertainties , increase with the size of the euro area .
People no longer have to change money , and pay transaction costs to do so , when travelling through the euro area .
The ECB as well as the European Commission will both prepare convergence reports , either every two years , or at the request of a Member State with a derogation .
All ECB convergence reports are available in the Publications section on this website .
The central banks of the new EU Member States are full members of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) and their respective Governors full members of the General Council .
The central banks » experts in the ESCB Committees have full-member status when the committees meet in ESCB composition , i.e. with all the EU national central banks ( NCBs ) , not just those in the euro area .
« Euroisation » runs counter to the underlying economic rationale of EMU , which envisages the eventual adoption of the euro as the end point of a convergence process within a multilateral framework .
ERM II is a multilateral arrangement in which non-euro area Member States » currencies are pegged to the euro and in which decisions are taken by mutual agreement of the parties concerned .
A Member State can maintain a euro-based currency board arrangement ( CBA ) as a unilateral commitment within ERM II provided that there is a mutual agreement about the fixed exchange rate prevailing under the CBA and which then serves as that currency 's ERM II central rate .
The Governors of the national central banks of all EU member states are full members of the General Council of the ECB , which also comprises the ECB 's President and Vice-President .
After the new Member States have adopted the euro , the Governors of the respective central banks will become members of the Governing Council of the ECB .
However , the number of members with voting rights will be capped at 21 : six permanent voting rights for the members of the Executive Board and 15 voting rights for the Governors of national central banks , to be exercised on the basis of a rotation system .
The cash changeover should not lead to a general rise in prices .
Although there was much discussion about price increases in the euro area linked to the introduction of the euro , the empirical evidence does not suggest that it had , on average , a strong upward effect on prices .
Changes in relative prices are a normal feature of all market economies .
Countries can reduce the likelihood of prices being affected by informing consumers and producers well in advance , by seeking agreements from retailers on price change conventions , and by using dual pricing during the crucial months .
New euro area members can certainly benefit from the experience gained during the 2002 cash changeover .

Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2182/2004 of 6 December 2004 concerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins ,
Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2183/2004 of 6 December 2004 extending to the non-participating Member States the application of Regulation ( EC ) No 2182/2004 concerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins ,
At its meeting on 4 June 2009 , on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
The current rates are appropriate taking into account the Governing Council 's decisions of early May , including the enhanced credit support measures , and all the information and analyses which have become available since then .
The Governing Council reiterated its expectation that price developments over the policy-relevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally .
Recent survey information indicates that , following two quarters of very negative growth , economic activity over the remainder of 2009 is expected to decline at much less negative rates .
After a stabilisation phase , positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010 .
This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects , such as a further deterioration in labour markets , which are likely to materialise over the coming months .
At the same time , available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
The outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure , as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis .
With regard to the economic analysis , reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil , and in particular a sharp fall in global demand and trade , economic activity weakened considerably in the first quarter of 2009 .
Forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections , taking into account the results of the first quarter .
In the view of the Governing Council , the risks to the economic outlook are balanced .
On the positive side , there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and from other policy measures taken .
With regard to price developments , annual HICP inflation was , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , 0.0% in May , compared with 0.6% in April .
The further decline in inflation rates was fully anticipated and primarily reflects base effects resulting from the sharp swings in global commodity prices over the past 12 months .
Looking ahead , owing to these base effects , annual inflation rates are projected to decline further and temporarily remain negative over the coming months , before returning to positive territory by the end of 2009 .
Such short-term movements are , however , not relevant from a monetary policy perspective .
Looking further ahead , price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere .
This outlook is consistent with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections for euro area inflation , in which annual HICP inflation is seen to range between 0.1% and 0.5% in 2009 , revised slightly downwards from the March 2009 ECB staff projections .
For 2010 , Eurosystem staff project annual HICP inflation to range between 0.6% and 1.4% , broadly unchanged from the March 2009 ECB staff projections .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion and thus support the assessment of moderate inflationary pressures .
In April , the annual growth rate of M3 declined further to 4.9% and that of loans to the private sector to 2.4% .
However , especially with regard to M3 growth , the pace of decline in annual growth rates was slower than in previous months , reflecting a brisk growth in monetary aggregates in April .
The latest developments in M3 components continue to reflect to a large extent the impact of past reductions in key ECB interest rates , which have led to declines both in the levels of different deposit interest rates and in the spreads between them .
This has implied , for instance , lower opportunity costs for market participants to shift funds into highly liquid overnight deposits and explains the strengthening of annual M1 growth to 8.4% in April .
At the same time , the reduced remuneration of other short-term deposits and marketable instruments continues to foster the allocation of funds to instruments outside M3 .
The past reductions in key ECB rates have continued to be passed on to lending rates to both non-financial corporations and households .
The resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead .
However , given the challenges which lie ahead , banks should take appropriate measures to further strengthen their capital bases and , where necessary , take full advantage of the government measures to support the financial sector , in particular as regards recapitalisation .
To sum up , the current key ECB interest rates are appropriate taking into account the Governing Council 's decisions of early May , including the enhanced credit support measures , and all the information and analyses which have become available since then .
Recent survey information indicates that , following two quarters of very negative growth , economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates .
A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure , as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis .
As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags , the Governing Council 's policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full .
Regarding fiscal policies , the latest projections by the European Commission point to a sharp increase in the euro area general government deficit and debt ratios in 2009 .
The deficit ratio is projected to rise to 5.3% of GDP in 2009 and further to 6.5% in 2010 , from 1.9% in 2008 , with the debt ratio exceeding 80 % of GDP in 2010 .
A large majority of euro area countries are expected to exceed the 3 % of GDP deficit reference value in 2009 and 2010 .
To ensure trust in the sustainability of public finances , an ambitious and credible adjustment effort will be required to return as soon as possible to sound fiscal positions , supported by a full application of the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact .
The rapid attainment of sound fiscal positions will be necessary to enable countries to deal with the additional fiscal burden owing to demographic ageing as well as the risks arising from government guarantees that were provided to stabilise financial sectors .
Turning to structural policies , there is a strong case for undertaking further efforts to support potential growth in the euro area .
It is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy .
In this respect , the current situation can be seen as a catalyst to accelerate the implementation of necessary domestic reforms , notably labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions , as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth .

The euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports , as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system .
In addition , low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment , and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further , thereby lowering consumption growth .
For these reasons , the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven .
On the upside , confidence may improve more than expected , and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected .
Inflation is expected to be around 1 % in the near term and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon .
In this context , it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
Consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact .
At its meeting on 15 January , on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 50 basis points , bringing the total reduction since 8 October 2008 to 225 basis points .
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was decreased to 2.00% , the rate on the marginal lending facility remained unchanged at 3.00% , and the rate on the deposit facility was set at 1.00% .
The decision to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations by a further 50 basis points takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook .
This takes into account the latest economic data releases and survey information , which add clear further evidence to the assessment that the euro area economy is experiencing a significant slowdown , largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil .
Both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period .
Monetary expansion is moderating further , supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing .
In particular , foreign demand for euro area exports has declined , and euro area domestic activity has contracted in the face of weaker demand prospects and tighter financing conditions .
Furthermore , the euro area should over time reap the full benefit from the effects of policy measures announced over recent weeks .
This is the best way to preserve and enhance confidence .
The significant measures being implemented by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should help to ensure trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households .
As emphasised on previous occasions , the significant decline in headline inflation in the second half of 2008 reflects mainly the sharp falls in global commodity prices over the past few months .
Looking forward , lower commodity prices and weakening demand confirm that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing .
Looking over the policy-relevant , medium-term horizon , annual HICP inflation is expected to be in line with price stability .
This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term .
Risks to price stability over the medium term are broadly balanced .
Unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation , while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed .
In analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-September 2008 has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly .
Overall , however , looking to the extent possible through this volatility , the rate of broad money growth continues to moderate in line with the trend established over the past 18 months , with the intensification of financial tensions since September leading to significant substitution among the components of M3 , rather than , at least so far , sharp changes in the trend of M3 itself .
Turning to the evolution of bank loans , the tightening of financing conditions resulting from the intensification of the financial tensions has contributed to a slowdown in the flow of monetary financial institution ( MFI ) loans to the non-financial private sector in recent months .
More data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement about the severity and scope of credit constraints and their possible implications for economic activity .
To sum up , the decision to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 50 basis points on 15 January 2009 takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook .
The Governing Council considers the risks to price stability over the medium term to be broadly balanced .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms this view .
Regarding fiscal policies , the Governing Council welcomes the European Council 's reconfirmation of its full commitment to sustainable public finances .
In this respect , the current economic situation calls for particular prudence with regard to the adoption of extensive fiscal stimulus measures , taking into account the particular fiscal situation in each country .
The operation of automatic stabilisers will provide a relatively large and powerful fiscal impulse to the weakening economy , in addition to already announced expansionary fiscal policy measures and the government support for the banking sector .
It is therefore essential to return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible .
The significant fiscal loosening and the implied increase in government debt should in any case not risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances , thereby detracting from the effectiveness of a fiscal stimulus .

The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong , in a context of already ample liquidity .
Taking this perspective , there are several indications that higher short-term interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics , although they have not , as yet , significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion .
Following several years of robust monetary growth , the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample .
Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside , relating in particular to the domestic side .

On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council at its meeting on 6 November decided to reduce further the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 50 basis points to 3.25% , with effect from the start of the new reserve maintenance period on 12 November 2008 .
The intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time .
In such an environment , taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months , price , cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate .
At the same time , the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration .
All in all , the information available and the Governing Council 's current analysis indicate a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon , even though they have not disappeared completely .
The world economy as a whole is exposed to the adverse effects , as tensions increasingly spill over from the financial sector to the real economy and from advanced economies to emerging market economies .
In the case of the euro area , the latest survey data confirm that momentum in economic activity has weakened significantly , with sluggish domestic and external demand and tighter financing conditions .
It is equally important for the banking sector to take fully into account the significant support measures adopted by governments to deal with the financial turmoil .
In the view of the Governing Council , a number of the downside risks to economic activity identified earlier have materialised , particularly those stemming from the financial market tensions .
Other downside risks continue to relate to disorderly developments due to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures , as well as to the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices .
The continued high level of inflation is largely due to both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level .
Moreover , strong wage growth in the first half of the year , in spite of a weaker growth momentum , combined with a deceleration in labour productivity growth during the same period , resulted in a significant increase in unit labour cost .
Looking forward , recent sharp falls in commodity prices , as well as the ongoing weakening in demand , suggest that the annual HICP inflation rate will continue to decline in the coming months and reach a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009 .
Depending , in particular , on the future path of oil and other commodity prices , some even stronger downside movements in HICP inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year , particularly due to base effects .
The remaining upside risks relate to an unexpected increase in commodity prices , as well as in indirect taxes and administered prices , and the emergence of broad-based , second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour , particularly in economies where nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices .
The Governing Council continues to call for these schemes to be abolished .
It is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the annual growth rates of broad money and credit aggregates , while still remaining strong , continued to decline in September .
Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective , monetary data up to September confirm that upside risks to price stability are diminishing but that they have not disappeared completely .
A closer examination of the money and credit data indicates that the recent intensification of financial tensions has already had an identifiable impact , particularly in the form of outflows from money market funds and greater inflows into overnight deposits .
However , the full impact of investors » uncertainty on their portfolio allocation behaviour is still to be seen in the coming months .
Both portfolio shifts between non-monetary and monetary assets and shifts between different types of monetary assets can therefore not be ruled out in the period ahead .
Hence , such effects will need to be taken into account when assessing monetary growth and its implications for price stability over the medium term .
There is also some evidence in the September data that the recent intensification and broadening of the financial tensions has triggered a slower provision of bank credit to euro area residents , mostly taking the form of smaller holdings of securities .
At the same time , for the euro area as a whole , up to September there were no indications of a drying-up in the availability of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations .
In particular , the maturity composition of loans suggests that non-financial corporations continued to obtain funding , also at relatively long maturities .
However , more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement .
To sum up , the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that there is a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon , even though they have not disappeared completely .
Accordingly , and as recently confirmed by the ECOFIN Council and the European Council , the fiscal policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact should continue to be applied fully .
The fiscal rules are one of the indispensable pillars of EMU and the single currency , which must remain firmly in place so as not to undermine the confidence in fiscal sustainability .
Finally , the current situation calls for the high quality and timeliness of statistical information on government interventions to ensure the transparent and accountable use of public funds .
Turning to structural policies , the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook will require a significant degree of resilience from the euro area economy .
The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms so that countries may fully exploit the benefits offered by the enhancement of international trade and market integration , in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition .
The first article explains why , from a monetary policy perspective , it is important to monitor labour cost developments and competitiveness indicators across euro area countries .
The second article presents a framework for valuing stock markets and equity risk premia .
The ECB earned a surplus of Euros 992 million in 2005 .
An equivalent amount was set aside in a provision against foreign exchange rate , interest rate and gold price risks , leaving a declared net profit of exactly nil .
Interest income in 2005 was favourably affected by higher interest rates on US dollar-denominated assets .
The ECB paid remuneration of Euros 710 million to the national central banks ( NCBs ) on their claims in respect of the foreign reserve assets transferred by them to the ECB .
In 2005 this remuneration resulted in an interest expense of Euros 710 million , compared with net interest income of Euros 889 million earned on the foreign reserve assets .
Based on the ECB 's estimated financial result for the year , the Governing Council decided in December 2005 :
to recall the three quarterly interim distributions already paid to the NCBs during the year , amounting to Euros 634 million in total ;
to withhold the final quarterly interim distribution of Euros 234 million .

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2004/39 / EC and 2009 /...
Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided at its meeting on 8 July 2010 to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
Taking into account all the new information which has become available since its meeting on 10 June 2010 , the Governing Council continues to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon , benefiting from low domestic price pressures .
The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010 .
The Governing Council expects real GDP to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area .
According to the Governing Council 's assessment , the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced , in an environment of high uncertainty .
In addition , a stronger or more protracted than previously expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector , renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices , and protectionist pressures , as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances , may weigh on the downside .
Looking ahead , in 2011 inflation rates should overall remain moderate , benefiting from low domestic price pressures .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the annual growth rate of M3 was unchanged at - 0.2% in May 2010 .
The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased slightly further but , at 0.2% , remained weak .
Shorter-term developments in M3 and some of its components and counterparts have remained volatile and , given the continued tensions in some financial market segments , this volatility may well persist .
However , at 10.3% , annual M1 growth is still very strong .
The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments , with positive growth in loans to households and negative growth in loans to non-financial corporations .
While the monthly flow in bank loans to non-financial corporations was positive in May , in the light of the volatility observed in recent months it is too early to judge whether this signals a turning-point .
The data up to May confirm that the size of banks » overall balance sheets has increased since the turn of the year .
As regards fiscal policies , the focus clearly needs to be on ensuring the sustainability of public finances .
In the current environment , all euro area countries must , as a minimum , comply with their fiscal consolidation plans as foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures .
Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits .
Regarding the proposals submitted by the Governing Council to the Task Force on Economic Governance established by the European Council under the chairmanship of President Van Rompuy , in the view of the Governing Council a quantum leap in terms of progress towards strengthening the institutional foundations of EMU is needed .
It is essential that governance and enforcement structures in the economic policy framework of the euro area be strengthened .
Reinforcing surveillance of national budgetary policies and ensuring rigorous compliance with the fiscal rules will be key .
Furthermore , it is extremely important that close oversight of relative competitiveness developments be implemented and that a surveillance mechanism be established to address imbalances in the euro area countries .
At the same time , it is important to establish an appropriate euro area crisis management framework that minimises moral hazard .

At its meeting of 6 July 2006 , the Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) decided to explore , in cooperation with central securities depositories ( CSDs ) and other market participants , the possibility of setting up a new Eurosystem service for securities settlement , to be called TARGET2-Securities ( T2S ) .
On the basis of such proposals , the Governing Council shall appoint members of the T2S Programme Board on 23 April 2009 .
Article 2 Final provision This Decision shall enter into force on 20 March 2009 .
ANNEX MANDATE OF THE T2S PROGRAMME BOARD In line with the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , the Eurosystem aims to offer its T2S Services to CSDs in Europe no later than 2013 .

The latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand .
The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term , given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth .
Starting with the economic analysis , following the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter increase in real GDP in the third quarter of 2009 , the latest information confirms that towards the end of last year economic activity in the euro area continued to expand .
However , a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature .
Furthermore , there is likely to be a drag on activity for some time to come on account of the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors , both inside and outside the euro area .
Confidence may also improve further , and the global economy as well as foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected .
With regard to price developments , as expected , euro area annual HICP inflation increased further in December 2009 to stand at 0.9% , after 0.5% in November .
Turning to the monetary analysis , both the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector were negative in November , standing at - 0.2% and - 0.7% respectively .
The concurrent declines to historically low growth rates recorded in these two series over the past months support the assessment of a decelerating underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term .
Looking ahead , M3 and credit growth are likely to remain very weak or negative for some time to come .
At the same time , the interest rate constellation continues to foster divergent developments in the main components of M3 , as the narrow spreads between the rates on different short-term bank deposits reduce the opportunity costs of shifting funds from , for instance , short-term time deposits into overnight deposits .
As a result , M1 continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 12.6% in November , when annual M3 growth turned negative .
The negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector conceals a return to positive annual rates of growth in the case of loans to households , while the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations became more negative .
Such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities , with turning points in the growth of loans to enterprises typically lagging those in economic activity .
In the case of households , the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates .
In the case of non-financial corporations , the decline in loans continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity , while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive .
The subdued levels of production and trade , as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook , will probably continue to dampen firms » demand for bank financing in the months to come .
In the meantime , financing conditions for enterprises have improved over recent months in terms of the cost of both bank credit and market financing .
In this respect , the continued negative flows in short-term bank loans to non-financial corporations observed in recent months may partly reflect better possibilities for substitution with different sources of longer-term financing .
Banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets , mainly through downsizing the assets held vis-à-vis other banks .
The challenge remains to adjust the size and structure of balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector .
To address this challenge , banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases and , where necessary , take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term , given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth .
The Governing Council will also continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past .
As regards fiscal policies , many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances .
Moreover , high levels of public deficit and debt would place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the credibility of the provisions of both the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union .
The Governing Council therefore calls upon governments to decide and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions , with a strong focus on expenditure reforms .
Tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term , when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre .
In this regard , current government commitments to start consolidation in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark for adjustment of 0.5% of GDP per annum represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries .
The success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend , crucially , on appropriate national budgetary rules and institutions and requires transparent budgetary procedures , as well as reliable and complete government finance statistics .
Turning to structural reforms , an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role .
The Eurosystem will submit its response to the European Commission 's public consultation on the EU 2020 strategy , which is designed as a successor to the current Lisbon strategy .
To address future challenges , the EU 2020 strategy should focus on raising potential growth and creating high levels of employment through well-functioning labour and product markets , sound financial systems and sustainable fiscal policies .
The aim is to achieve a highly competitive social market economy , as spelled out in the Treaty .
The second article reviews the relations of the ECB with the other relevant institutions and bodies in the European Union which have been established since the launch of the euro .
Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council adapting a number of instruments subject to the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty to Council Decision 1999/468 / EC , as amended by Decision 2006/512 / EC , with regard to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny ( COM ( 2007 ) 741 ) , pdf 391 kB , en

At its meeting on 1 December 2005 , the Governing Council of the ECB decided to increase the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points to 2.25% .
The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also increased by 25 basis points to 3.25% and 1.25% respectively .
In line with the changes in the ECB 's monetary policy framework in March 2004 , these decisions came into effect at the start of the new reserve maintenance period on 6 December .
On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points after two and a half years of maintaining rates at historically low levels .
The decision to increase interest rates was warranted so as to adjust the accommodative stance of the ECB 's monetary policy and thus take into account the risks to price stability identified in the economic analysis and confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary analysis .
The Governing Council 's decision will contribute to keeping medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth in the euro area .
In fact , interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum continue to remain very low in both nominal and real terms .
Thus , the monetary policy of the ECB remains accommodative and continues to lend considerable support to sustainable economic activity and job creation .
The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability .
Starting with the economic analysis underlying the Governing Council 's assessment , recent data and survey evidence indicate that economic activity has strengthened in the second half of this year .
According to Eurostat 's first estimate , real GDP growth was 0.6% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2005 , after 0.3% in the first and 0.4% in the second quarter .
Moreover , the information on business confidence broadly remains consistent with continued economic growth towards the end of the year .
Looking ahead , on the external side , ongoing growth in global demand should support euro area exports , while on the domestic side , investment should benefit from continued favourable financing conditions and the robust growth of corporate earnings .
Private consumption should grow broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income .
At the same time , the outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks , relating mainly to higher than expected oil prices , concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence .
Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a similar picture .
In comparison with the September 2005 ECB staff projections , the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been revised slightly upwards .
In that respect , it is of crucial importance to take a strictly forward-looking perspective , which does not allow much comfort to be drawn from the current , comparatively lower rates for measures of inflation that exclude certain components , such as energy or certain categories of food .
Such measures of « core » inflation have , at least in the past , been shown to lag behind , rather than lead , the developments in headline inflation .
In addition , the increase in energy prices to a large extent reflects higher global demand for energy .
While it is difficult to quantify precisely this effect , it would appear inappropriate to exclude energy from the price index and at the same time retain other items , such as internationally traded manufactured goods .
Owing to the same forces of globalisation , these goods currently exhibit little upward movement in prices and even suggest a downward trend .
All in all , in line with the monetary policy strategy of the ECB , a comprehensive and forward-looking analysis of the main underlying developments driving the outlook for price stability is warranted .
This comprehensive assessment encompasses the information contained in various measures of inflation .
Underlying these projections is the assumption that wage increases will remain contained , as has been the case over recent quarters .
Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture .
Such risks relate to uncertainties arising from oil market developments , the pass-through of previous oil price increases to consumers via the domestic production chain , the possibility of second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour , as well as further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes .
Evidence pointing to increased upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term comes from the monetary analysis .
The decision of 1 December will contribute to keeping medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability .
Keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability will permit monetary policy to continue to make a significant contribution towards a sustainable recovery in economic growth and job creation in the euro area .
To this end , the Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments relevant to the medium-term outlook for price stability .
As regards fiscal policies , euro area countries are now finalising their 2006 budgets and stability programmes .
Plans in some countries to foster sound public finances and to undertake fiscal reforms that boost economic growth and prepare for the challenges related to population ageing are welcome .
However , in countries with fiscal imbalances , the speed of consolidation is disappointingly slow and there is a high risk that commitments are not being met .
It is , therefore , essential that fiscal consolidation is prioritised again as part of a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform programme .
This would build confidence in the proper functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact and be the best way in which fiscal policies in the euro area can underpin economic growth .
With respect to structural reforms , the Governing Council welcomed the 2005-2008 Lisbon National Reform Programmes that were submitted by EU Member States in October and November 2005 , in line with the renewed Lisbon Strategy .
These programmes present key country-specific challenges and structural reform measures to increase growth and employment .
To this end , it is important to match ambitious objectives with concrete policy measures and take new reform initiatives , and to monitor , evaluate and communicate the reform process effectively .
Luc Luycx of the Royal Belgian Mint , designer of the common side of the euro coins , at work in Brussels
On 6 April 2005 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates ( hereinafter the « proposed regulation ') .
The objective of the proposed regulation is to establish a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates .
On the one hand , under this framework Member States will report data on foreign affiliates resident in the compiling country but controlled by a foreign institutional unit .
Annex I to the proposed regulation lays down a common module for such inward statistics on foreign affiliates ( hereinafter « inward FATS ') .
On the other hand , the reporting of data on foreign affiliates not resident in the compiling country but controlled by an institutional unit resident in the compiling country is currently voluntary and will be subject to pilot studies to be conducted by some Member States at the latest within three years after entry into force of the proposed regulation .
Annex II to the proposed regulation lays down a common module for such outward statistics on foreign affiliates ( hereinafter « outward FATS ') .
By defining a common framework , the proposed regulation should improve the comparability of data on foreign affiliates throughout the EU , thereby making them more suitable for aggregation at the EU and / or euro area level and more reliable for all users .
Data on foreign affiliates are currently compiled by national statistical institutes ( usually inward FATS ) and central banks ( usually outward FATS ) of the Member States .
Another issue is the deadline of 20 months from the end of the reference year for Member States to transmit inward FATS currently provided for in Section 5 of Annex I to the proposed regulation .
This would appear to be the maximum possible time limit for ensuring a regular assessment of economic developments involving ( frequent ) changes in the structure of large corporations and the number , size , and sector of economic activity of their affiliates .
Following a more detailed assessment of Annexes I to III to the proposed regulation the ECB notes that Section 6 of Annex I to Regulation ( EC ) No 184/2005 entitled « Geographical breakdown levels » includes an additional item entitled « U4 Extra-euro-zone » alongside other EU-wide items .
The ECB considers that in order to produce the euro area aggregate , it would be useful to include a similar reference to the « Extra-euro area » in Annex III to the proposed regulation as an additional geographical breakdown level under the heading « Level 1 » .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 3.1 , Article 4 ( a ) and Article 5 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank , as the proposed regulation contains provisions concerning the smooth operation of payment systems and the collection of balance of payments statistics .
( 2 ) Regulation ( EC ) No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2001 on cross-border payments in euro ( OJ L 344 , 28.12.2001 , p. 13 ) .
The reform of those systems may involve not only substantially lower reporting obligations for banks ( 1 ) but also an increase in the reporting burden on non-banks , which should be limited to the extent possible ( e.g. by applying proper survey and sampling techniques ) .
( 1 ) In line with Article 1 ( 3 ) of the proposed regulation , banks will still be required to report on their own cross-border financial and non-financial transactions .
( 2 ) In particular , this applies to small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) that receive payments from and / or send payments to non-resident bank accounts ( i.e. bank accounts with a non-resident country code in it ) .
This can serve as an indication that these SMEs are likely to be engaged in cross-border transactions .
assessment of the reporting population .
This would allow an automatic and unambiguous identification of cross-border payments by the bank of the payee in all cases .
This procedure should be applied without a threshold .
In order to further alleviate the reporting burden of both financial and non-financial agents , the ECB supports all initiatives that facilitate the exchange of information between b.o.p. compilers , for statistical purposes only .
This may require the elimination of legal impediments to the exchange of information among EU statistical authorities , while maintaining the required confidentiality safeguards .
To assist the Commission , the ECB would be ready to explore ways forward within this area .
Such an interim solution has been discussed within the Eurosystem , resulting in the following proposal by the ECB : --- one single field of the SEPA payment message should be used during this interim period for reporting in a fully harmonised way ( including one code list and one methodology to apply this code list ) .
Customers in Member States implementing this approach will be required to provide the information to fill in one , already existing , specific optional white field in the SEPA message ( field « Regulatory Reporting ') .
One common set of usage rules should be applied by banks in all these Member States , creating one additional optional service ( AOS ) community .
The set of usage rules would only apply between the Member States which decide to implement this approach .
The EPC should be informed and asked to help in co-ordinating the implementation of the AOS , --- banks and customers resident in Member States not implementing this approach will neither have to adopt the set of usage rules nor do they have to introduce , transmit or read the b.o.p. codes .
Once the coded information is introduced in the SEPA message , its treatment is fully automated by banks , without hampering the straight through processing of the payment .
Furthermore the ECB recommends to closely monitor the developments in the coming years , taking into account technical developments in SEPA and developments in statistical collection methods .
According to Article 12 ( 1 ) of the proposed regulation , the Commission must , by December 2012 at the latest , present to the European Parliament , the Council , the European Economic and Social Committee and the ECB a report on the use of IBAN and BIC in relation to the automation of payments , accompanied by an appropriate proposal .
On the assumption that the aim of this provision is to facilitate and make more efficient the initiation of payments , the ECB would support the possible abolition of the need for retail customers to use the BIC if the use of IBAN only is technically possible , as this would ease the burden of providing two different identifiers .
( 1 ) If this step were to be taken , the European Payments Council ( EPC ) would have to be requested to make mandatory the existing field on the country of residence of the payer , currently optional in the SEPA message ( and possibly to agree on a codification ) .
Charges for cross-border payments and corresponding national payments Article 3 ( 1 ) of the proposed regulation provides for the principle of equality of charges in respect of cross-border payments and corresponding domestic payments « of the same value » .
The only criterion for identifying the corresponding domestic payment in the proposed regulation is the reference to the value of such equivalent payments .
In this respect , the ECB is concerned that the abovementioned provision might not provide payment service providers with adequate interpretation guidelines with regard to the notion of the corresponding domestic payments .
Hence , the ECB proposes introducing a paragraph setting out the basic assessment criteria in order to ensure its uniform application within the Community , instead of allowing payment service providers a wide margin of discretion as regards its interpretation .
Scope of application Regulation ( EC ) No 2560/2001 applies to « institutions » , and its Article 2 ( e ) defines them as « any natural or legal person which , by way of business , executes cross-border payments » .
Article 1 ( 1 ) of the PSD sets out categories of payment service providers , including the ECB and NCBs when not acting in their capacity as monetary authorities .
It follows from the abovementioned provisions that the proposed regulation would apply to cross-border payments up to EUR 50 000 made by the ECB or NCBs when they are acting outside the scope of their capacity as monetary authorities and when such transactions are not made for their own account .
The ECB welcomes the extended scope of the proposed regulation in this respect , which is in line with the principles of SEPA .
Additional legal comments The ECB supports the proposed regulation 's objective of complying with standards of good legislation and agrees with the introduction of the simplified definition framework .
However , a certain overlap seems to exist between the notion of « cross-border payments » and « payment transaction » contained respectively in Article 2 ( 1 ) and Article 2 ( 7 ) of the proposed regulation .
The ECB is of the opinion that if a defined concept appears in more than one secondary Community legislation , the corresponding definition should , as far as possible , be identical in all such legislation to ensure legal certainty , especially in closely related legal acts .
However , there are some divergences between the concept of « payment instrument » as defined in Article 4 ( 23 ) of the PSD and its equivalent in Article 2 ( 2 ) of the proposed regulation .
In the PSD , reference is made to « payment order » whereas the definition in the proposed regulation refers to « payment transaction » .
This is unfortunate and could cause confusion , especially since both « payment order » and « payment transaction » are defined concepts in both the proposed regulation and the PSD .
Drafting proposals Where the above advice related to Article 2 ( 1 ) and Article 3 of the proposed regulation would lead to changes in the proposed regulation , drafting proposals are set out in the Annex .
Celebrating the introduction of the euro in Brussels on 1 January 1999
Executive Board member Sirkka Hämäläinen visiting the ECB 's market room
Euro banknote production started in 1999 in printing works across the EU .
Looking further ahead , the conditions remain in place for moderate economic growth to continue .
With regard to consumer prices , Eurostat 's flash estimate for annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in March , unchanged from February .
In the coming months , annual inflation rates are likely to remain somewhat above 2 %, although the exact figure will depend largely on how oil prices develop .
Looking further ahead , so far there has been no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area .
Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and , in the context of moderate economic growth and weak labour markets , this trend is likely to continue for the time being .
However , upside risks to price stability remain .
The monetary analysis provides further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons .
While the latest monetary and credit data show some moderation in the pace of monetary expansion , they confirm that the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates has remained the dominating force .
In addition , the fact that monetary dynamics continue to be driven mainly by the most liquid components suggests that excess liquidity may entail risks of upward inflationary pressures in the medium to longer term .
Furthermore , strong monetary and credit growth indicates the need to carefully monitor whether risks are building up in the context of strong house price increases in some regions of the euro area .
To sum up , the economic analysis confirms that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained , while there continue to be medium-term upside risks to price stability which need to be monitored closely .
Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of such risks .
Turning to fiscal policies , recent information provides a mixed picture and continues to raise concerns .
Although public finances remain sound in a few euro area countries and fiscal consolidation is progressing slowly in others , in several countries fiscal perspectives are worrying , as imbalances are not projected to decline , as planned earlier , and in some cases are even forecast to rise .
Given that inappropriate consolidation strategies and shortcomings in their implementation have , in the past , made compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact difficult , it is now essential that consolidation plans are ambitious and are fully implemented .
It is equally essential that the European Commission and the ECOFIN Council strictly enforce the new agreement on the implementation of the Pact so as to restore the framework 's credibility .
The Governing Council would also like to reiterate the need to deliver on fiscal and structural reforms that enhance the sustainability of public finances and confidence in the growth prospects of all Member States .
As regards structural reforms in the euro area , the Governing Council welcomes the Presidency Conclusions of the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005 , which state that « it is essential to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy without delay and re-focus priorities on growth and employment » .
EU countries urgently need to promote innovation and human capital formation , establish a regulatory environment which is friendlier for businesses , accelerate market liberalisation , and increase labour market flexibility .
Attention must now shift towards implementing this reform agenda .
The first article addresses the issue of asset price bubbles and monetary policy .
The operating procedures for the exchange rate mechanism in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union ( ERM II ) are laid down in the agreement of 1 September 1998 between the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks ( NCBs ) of the Member States outside the euro area ( ERM II Central Bank Agreement ) .
As of 1 May 2004 , the NCBs of the ten new Member States of the European Union have become parties to the ERM II Central Bank Agreement .
As a result of the adoption of the euro by Slovenia , Banka Slovenije is now a full member of the Eurosystem , with the same rights and obligations as the 12 national central banks of the other EU Member States that have adopted the euro .
The list of monetary financial institutions located in Slovenia and subject to reserve requirements is published on the ECB 's website , as are the lists of the other EU Member States that have adopted the euro .
In particular , loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis , their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors .
Thus , when the counterparts of M3 are considered , the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector .
Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .

Since 1 January 1999 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has been responsible for conducting monetary policy for the euro area - the world &rsquo; s largest economy after the United States .
The euro area came into being when responsibility for monetary policy was transferred from the national central banks of 11 EU Member States to the ECB in January 1999 .
Greece joined in 2001 , Slovenia in 2007 , Cyprus and Malta in 2008 , Slovakia in 2009 .
The creation of the euro area and of a new supranational institution , the ECB , was a milestone in the long and complex process of European integration .
To join the euro area , the 16 countries had to fulfil the convergence criteria , as will other EU Member States prior to adopting the euro .
The legal basis for the single monetary policy is the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank .
The ECB and the national central banks together perform the tasks they have been entrusted with .
The Eurosystem comprises the ECB and the NCBs of those countries that have adopted the euro .
In particular , Article 4 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1338/2001 should be amended , and Article 4 ( 3 ) accordingly deleted .
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community , and in particular Article 106 ( 1 ) thereof ,
Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
the governors / presidents of all the national central banks ( NCBs ) of the euro area , i.e. , those EU Member States that have adopted the euro .
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB Statute ) assign to the Governing Council the power to take the most important and strategically significant decisions for the Eurosystem .
When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the Eurosystem , the members of the Governing Council act not as national representatives but in a fully independent capacity .
The Governing Council currently meets twice a month , usually on the first and third Thursday .
Interest rate decisions are normally discussed at the first meeting of the month only .
The President of the EU Council / Eurogroup and a member of the European Commission may attend the meetings , but without having the right to vote .
Each member of the Governing Council has one vote and , unless otherwise provided for in the ESCB Statute , the Governing Council acts by simple majority .
Although the proceedings of the meetings are confidential , the Governing Council makes the outcome of its deliberations public , primarily those about setting the key interest rates , via a press conference which is held after the first Governing Council meeting of each month .
In addition , the Governing Council is the supreme decision-making body for the administration and functioning of the ECB itself .
In particular , the Governing Council adopts the Rules of Procedure of the ECB and is competent with regard to its finances , budget and appropriation of the annual financial results .
Physical gold , i.e. bars , coins , plates , nuggets , in storage or « under way » .

18 December 2003 - Policy position of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank on exchange rate issues relating to the acceding countries
Today the Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has published a policy position on exchange rate issues relating to the acceding countries that will join the European Union in May 2004 .
The ten new Member States will all join the European Union as Member States with a derogation in the field of European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) .
This means that , while not yet adopting the euro , they will be committed to striving towards the eventual adoption of the euro upon fulfilment of the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community .
The Treaty foresees that at some point following accession , new Member States will join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II ( ERM II ) .
Interventions may be carried out either directly by the ECB ( centralised ) and / or by national central banks ( NCBs ) acting on behalf of the ECB ( decentralised ) , on a disclosed agency basis .
Whether the execution of the intervention is centralised or decentralised is irrelevant from the point of view of the ultimate objective of the operation .
Foreign exchange interventions may also take place within the framework of the exchange rate mechanism II ( ERM II ) , which entered into force at the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) .
Foreign exchange interventions can , inter alia , be conducted in the context of institutional exchange rate relations between the euro and the currencies of countries outside the European Union ( e.g. the US dollar and the Japanese yen ) .
With regard to these currencies , Article 111 of the Treaty defines two possible alternative institutional set-ups :
Formal agreements : the ECOFIN Council can conclude formal agreements on an exchange rate system for the euro .
General orientations : the ECOFIN Council can formulate general orientations for the Eurosystem 's exchange rate policy .

The Governing Council continues to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon , thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households .
As regards the economic analysis , reflecting the impact of the intensified and broadened financial market turmoil , economic activity throughout the world , including in the euro area , has weakened substantially .
Foreign demand for euro area exports has declined and domestic factors , notably very low confidence and tight financing conditions , have adversely affected domestic demand .
Taken together with other available economic data for the euro area , this points to very negative quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the last quarter of 2008 .
Over time , the euro area should reap the benefit of the effects of the significant policy measures that have been decided upon over recent months to deal with the financial turmoil and its adverse consequences .
They should help to restore trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households .
Looking over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon , annual HICP inflation is expected to be in line with price stability .
Regarding risks to price stability over the medium term , unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation , while upside risks to price stability could materialise , particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the latest evidence confirms a continued deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area , supporting the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing .
In analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil since September 2008 has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly .
Overall , looking through this volatility , the underlying pace of broad money expansion continues to decelerate gradually from the peak seen in early 2007 .
However , the intensification and broadening of financial tensions since September 2008 is leading to significant substitution among the components of M3 .
Turning to the evolution of bank credit , the flow of MFI loans to the private sector moderated in the course of 2008 , largely on account of a weakness in loans to households , especially for house purchase .
In December , however , outstanding MFI loans to non-financial corporations contracted for the first time since the onset of the financial turmoil , confirming the significant weakening of corporate credit at the end of the year after a long period of dynamic growth .
At the same time , the substantial reduction in key ECB interest rates since October 2008 appears to have been passed through to lower bank lending rates , thereby easing financing conditions for companies and households .
Moreover , there are some indications that the pace of tightening of bank credit standards is stabilising , albeit at high levels by historical standards .
Overall , the incoming information on financing conditions requires continuous close monitoring .
To sum up , as anticipated in the interest rate decision of 15 January 2009 , the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing an extended period of significant economic downturn , and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing .
Turning to fiscal policy , the European Commission projects in its January 2009 interim forecast a substantial rise in the average euro area government budget deficit , to 4.0% of GDP in 2009 , from 1.7% in 2008 .
This rapid deterioration of the fiscal position is broad-based among euro area countries and is due to the significant economic downturn , additional revenue shortfalls and the fiscal stimulus measures adopted by many governments .
Seven euro area countries are currently expected by the Commission to exceed the 3 % of GDP reference value for the budget deficit in 2009 .
In addition , many governments have assumed large contingent liabilities in connection with guarantees provided to banks and will need to finance capital injections in support of the financial sector .
To support the public 's confidence in the sustainability of public finances , it is therefore essential that governments return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible .
As regards structural policies , it is important to continue on the long-term reform path foreseen by the Lisbon agenda .
At the current juncture , it is essential to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition , resisting any protectionist pressure .
In several countries , it is also crucial to take measures with a view to addressing competitiveness losses accumulated over recent years .
In the course of time , other European countries joined the then European Communities ( EC ) - or , since the Maastricht Treaty ( 1992 ) , the European Union - in several rounds of accession .
The Single Market was to be formally completed at the end of 1992 , but there is still work to be done in some areas - for example , creating a genuinely single market in financial services .

The aim of the PSD is to ensure that payments within the EU -- in particular credit transfer , direct debit and card payments -- become as easy , efficient , and secure as domestic payments within a Member State , by providing the legal foundation to make the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA ) possible .
The PSD will reinforce the rights and protection of all the users of payment services ( consumers , retailers , large and small companies and public authorities ) .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the European Commission share a common vision for the SEPA and constantly monitor and support the process leading to its realisation .

The Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) today decided , by means of a teleconference , on the following two measures :
As from the operation settled on 15 October , the weekly main refinancing operations will be carried out through a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment at the interest rate on the main refinancing operation , i.e. currently 3.75% .
As of 9 October , the ECB will reduce the corridor of standing facilities from 200 basis points to 100 basis points around the interest rate on the main refinancing operation .
Therefore , as of 9 October , the rate of the marginal lending facility will be reduced from 100 to 50 basis points above the interest rate on the main refinancing operation , i.e. currently to 4.25% , and the rate of the deposit facility will be increased from 100 to 50 basis points below the interest rate on the main refinancing operation , i.e. currently to 3.25% .
The two measures will remain in place for as long as needed , and at least until the end of the first maintenance period of 2009 , on 20 January .
At today 's meeting , which was held in Lisbon , the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 1.00% , 1.75% and 0.25% respectively .

In the Audit Charter , the Executive Board of the European Central Bank defines the purpose , authority and responsibility of the ECB 's Directorate Internal Audit ( D-IA ) and specifies D-IA 's contribution to the corporate governance of the ECB .
The Directorate Internal Audit provides independent and objective assurance and consulting services designed to improve the ECB 's operations .
It helps the ECB to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management , control and governance processes .
All activities , operations and processes of the ECB may be subject to internal auditing .
Furthermore , D-IA reviews the Eurosystem 's tasks and activities ( joint components ) in accordance with the ESCB Audit Policy .
D-IA also implements the Eurosystem / ESCB audit plan by coordinating internal auditing activities for the Eurosystem / ESCB-wide common infrastructure and operations , including contributions to the development and harmonisation of audit methods and standards .
Independence and objectivity To ensure its independence , D-IA functions under the direct responsibility of the Executive Board and reports to the President of the ECB .
The Director Internal Audit , within the framework of this Charter , defines the operational principles for the performance of D-IA in an Internal Audit Manual .
Access to information In performing its responsibilities , D-IA has access to all people , records , information , systems and property deemed necessary .
D-IA immediately informs the Executive Board of any attempt to hinder it in the performance of its duties .
Incident reporting ECB business areas inform D-IA without delay of any major or significant incident observed .
In this respect , D-IA may also require permanent ( read-only ) access to incident and change databases .
Relationship with the ECB Audit Committee To provide assistance to the Governing Council , the Audit Committee receives the audit reports of D-IA and of the Internal Auditors Committee ( IAC ) .
The Audit Committee receives systematically the executive summaries of the reports and the full reports are available upon request .
The Eurosystem , which comprises the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Member States whose currency is the euro , is the monetary authority of the euro area .
We jointly contribute , strategically and operationally , to attaining our common goals , with due respect to the principle of decentralisation .
We are committed to good governance and to performing our tasks effectively and efficiently , in a spirit of cooperation and teamwork .
The euro was launched on 1 January 1999 , when it became the currency of more than 300 million people in Europe .
For the first three years it was an invisible currency , only used for accounting purposes , e.g. in electronic payments .
Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002 , when it replaced , at fixed conversion rates , the banknotes and coins of the national currencies like the Belgian franc and the Deutsche Mark .
Euro banknotes ( and coins ) circulate widely in the euro area mainly because of tourism , business travel and cross-border shopping .
To a much more limited extent , national banknotes , before the introduction of the euro , also « moved » across borders and then had to be « repatriated » , mainly through the commercial banking system , to the central bank that issued them .
However , a smooth and efficient operation of payment systems requires a mix of instruments with different characteristics and merits .
In April 2001 the ECB 's Governing Council decided that the production of euro banknotes should be decentralised and pooled after the initial cash changeover .
The plan is to introduce the first denomination of the second series in the next few years .
Legally , both the ECB and the central banks of the euro area countries have the right to issue euro banknotes .
In practice , only the national central banks physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes ( as well as coins ) .
The ECB does not have a cash office and is not involved in any cash operations .
The ECB cannot perform these operations as it does not have its own technical departments ( distribution units , banknote processing units , vaults , etc .) .
The Agreement shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union .
The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention .

Further to the press release « Changes in tender procedures and in the standing facilities corridor » of 8 October 2008 , the Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) today decided the following :
The main refinancing operations will continue to be carried out through a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment beyond the maintenance period ending on 20 January 2009 .
As of 21 January 2009 , the corridor of standing facility rates , which on 9 October 2008 was reduced to 100 basis points around the prevailing interest rate of the main refinancing operation , will be restored to 200 basis points .
23 May 2008 - Publication of an indicative calendar for the Eurosystem 's tender operations in 2009
The European Central Bank is today publishing an indicative calendar for the Eurosystem 's tender operations in 2009 ( see the attached document ) .
Introduction of euro banknotes and coins ( 1 January 2002 )
10th anniversary of the euro and the Eurosystem
the ECB and the central banks of the EU countries adopting the euro came together to form the « Eurosystem » , and
monetary authority for the new currency was transferred to the Governing Council of the ECB .
Today , the single currency is used in an area that stretches from Cyprus to Ireland and from Portugal to Finland .

Overall , the continued vigour of underlying monetary and credit expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .
Those countries that have already achieved sound fiscal positions need to abstain from pro-cyclical fiscal policies .
The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track , although it is likely to remain uneven .
Overall , the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010 , in an environment marked by continued uncertainty .
In the case of the special-term refinancing operations , the fixed rate will be the same as the rate used in the respective MRO .
The Governing Council also decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the regular three-month longer-term refinancing operations ( LTROs ) , starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010 .
With these decisions , the Eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area at very favourable conditions , thereby facilitating the provision of credit to the euro area .
At the same time , these decisions help to avoid distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for longer than needed .
The Governing Council will continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures .
Turning to the economic analysis , over recent quarters , the euro area has continued to benefit from the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system , as well as from the ongoing recovery in the world economy .
In particular , a number of special factors are at play , including adverse weather conditions in parts of the euro area in the first quarter of 2010 .
This assessment is also reflected in the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area , which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 0.4% and 1.2% for 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.5% for 2011 .
Furthermore , there may be larger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken .
On the downside , concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector , renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices , the intensification of protectionist pressures and renewed tensions in some financial market segments , as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances .
With regard to price developments , euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.9% in February 2010 , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , after 1.0% in January .
This assessment is also reflected in the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area , which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 0.8% and 1.6% for 2010 and between 0.9% and 2.1% for 2011 .
The growth of M3 and loans to the private sector is likely to remain weak also in the coming months .
The negative annual growth of loans to the private sector conceals ongoing opposite developments : positive , strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand and negative , declining annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other hand .
Such differences are consistent with historical patterns and cyclical regularities , which suggest that loans to non-financial corporations can be expected to remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up .
At the same time , the cost of financing for enterprises has declined and the sector as a whole has continued to make extensive use of market-based financing as a substitute for bank financing .
Banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months , but the challenge remains for them to manage this adjustment while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector .
Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council 's aim of keeping inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % over the medium term .
As regards fiscal policies , high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union .
It is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead .
This requires determined efforts , notably on the side of countries with high deficit and debt levels .
Policies should be adopted which open up market access and increase competition .
Overall , it is essential to set the stage for long-term investment in innovation so as to create new business opportunities .
These structural reforms should be supported by an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector .
On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided at its meeting on 10 May 2007 to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
The information that has become available since the meeting of the Governing Council on 12 April has further underpinned the reasoning behind its decision to increase interest rates at the meeting on 8 March .
Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its momentum .
Investment should remain dynamic , benefiting from an extended period of favourable financing conditions , balance sheet restructuring , strong corporate earnings and gains in business efficiency .
With regard to price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in April 2007 , after 1.9% in March .
Looking at the coming months , barring further increases in oil prices , significant base effects deriving from last year 's energy price volatility will strongly influence the profile of annual inflation rates .
On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures , annual inflation rates are likely to fall somewhat in the months to come , before rising again towards the end of the year to hover at levels around 2 %.
It is crucial that the social partners meet their responsibilities so as to continue to avoid wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens .
In this context , it is also important to point out that wage agreements should be sufficiently differentiated and take into account price competitiveness positions , the still high level of unemployment in many economies and productivity developments across sectors .
The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the increasingly rapid growth of M3 , which in March reached an annual rate of 10.9% , as well as in the ongoing high levels of credit growth .
Monetary and credit expansion is due partly to the moderate level of interest rates and solid economic growth .
Short-term monetary and credit developments can be affected , inter alia , by the shape of the yield curve and external factors , and be subject to some degree of volatility .
Looking through such transitory aspects , there are , however , several indications that higher short-term interest rates are influencing monetary dynamics , although they have not , as yet , significantly dampened the overall strength of these dynamics .
For example , increases in short-term rates have served to moderate the expansion of the narrow aggregate , M1 , in recent quarters , but its annual growth is still robust .
All in all , taking into account both short-term factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit , there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons .
In fact , following several years of robust monetary growth , the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures .
In relation to fiscal policies , the Governing Council welcomes the recent commitment by the euro area finance ministers , at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April 2007 , to make full use of the current economic growth and better than expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies and to avoid procyclical policies in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact .
In the view of the Governing Council , this requires a rigorous implementation of 2007 budgets , the avoidance of expenditure overruns and the full allocation of unexpected extra revenues to deficit and debt reduction .
For 2008 , countries with remaining fiscal imbalances are expected to pursue more ambitious than planned budgetary targets .
As a result , all euro area countries should achieve their medium-term objective of sound budgetary positions as soon as possible and by 2010 at the latest .
As repeatedly stressed , the Governing Council fully supports structural reforms that enhance competition , increase productivity and foster economic flexibility , thus promoting the potential for real GDP growth and employment .
Increased productivity also allows for increases in real wages without negatively impacting on employment , thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area work force .
In recent years , average wage increases in the euro area as a whole have been rather moderate , making a vital contribution to job creation and lower unemployment .
It is important that this favourable trend in labour markets continues , so contributing to a prolonged and robust upswing .
In this respect , sufficient wage differentiation is required so as to improve employment opportunities for less-skilled workers and in sectors and regions with high unemployment .
Furthermore , the removal of impediments to labour mobility would help to address local imbalances in labour markets and to enhance the adjustment flexibility of euro area economies to economic shocks .
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 25 basis points to 1.25% , starting from the operation to be settled on 8 April 2009 .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be decreased by 25 basis points to 2.25% , with effect from 8 April 2009 .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be decreased by 25 basis points to 0.25% , with effect from 8 April 2009 .

The objective of price stability refers to the general level of prices in the economy and implies avoiding both prolonged inflation and deflation .
Maintaining social cohesion and stability : price stability prevents the considerable and arbitrary redistribution of wealth and income that arises in both inflationary and deflationary environments .
25 May 2007 - Publication of the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem 's tender operations in 2008
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) is today publishing the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem 's tender operations in 2008 ( see the document attached ) .
The indicative calendar is prepared in line with the procedures set out in « The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area : General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures » ( September 2006 ) .
This list is for manufacturers of banknote « auto-detection devices » and banknote handling machines as defined under the « Framework » .
Detailed information is gathered at the tender website .
On 5 September 2005 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Commission of the European Communities for an opinion on a draft Commission regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2494/95 as regards the common index reference period for the harmonised index of consumer prices , and amending Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 2214/96 ( hereinafter the « proposed regulation ') .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the first indent of Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and on Article 5 ( 3 ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices ( 1 ) .
The objective of the proposed regulation is to revise the common index reference period for all harmonised indices of consumer prices ( HICPs ) from 1996 = 100 to 2005 = 100 , and to establish the procedure for future updating of the index reference periods .
Furthermore , the proposed regulation sets technical specifications for the implementation of the new index reference period and the treatment of new subindices of the HICP .
The ECB has no comments on the technical specifications laid down in the proposed regulation .

ECONOMIA will help you understand these basics of central banking .
Your goal is to keep inflation low , at just under 2 %, and stable .
The interest rate decisions you take can achieve that - but they can also cause inflation to slow down or to rise sharply .
18 November 2004 - The Governing Council will continue its deliberations on the new ECB premises
In February 2004 the jury for the international urban planning and architectural design competition for the ECB 's new premises in Frankfurt am Main , Germany , chose three design concepts .
The Governing Council of the ECB then invited the three prize-winners to revise their design concepts to remedy functional and technical deficiencies identified by the jury .
At today 's meeting the Governing Council discussed the three revised design concepts and decided that they still needed further evaluation regarding , among other things , the ECB 's specific requirements .
The Governing Council will continue its deliberations with a view to coming to a conclusion by early next year at the latest .

Banknote re-issuance by credit institutions and other professional cash handlers
The possibility of re-issuing euro banknotes enables credit institutions and other professional cash handlers to perform their role in the currency supply in a more effective and more cost-efficient manner .
To ensure the integrity and preservation of the euro banknotes , the ECB established the

These checks can be done either by banknote handling machines , which have passed a test by an NCB , or by trained staff .
The incoming information and analyses that have become available since the meeting on 8 October have confirmed the Governing Council 's expectations .
While annual HICP inflation was - 0.1% in October , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon .
At the same time , the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year .
The Governing Council expects the euro area economy in 2010 to recover at a gradual pace , recognising that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty .
With regard to the economic analysis , available data and survey-based indicators continue to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year .
In particular , the euro area should benefit from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports , as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system .
Taking into account all available information , in the second half of this year , quarterly real GDP growth rates could be back in positive territory .
However , uncertainty remains high as a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature .
Looking through the volatility of incoming data , the euro area economy is expected to recover at a gradual pace in 2010 , as it is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the non-financial sector , both inside and outside the euro area .
With regard to price developments , annual HICP inflation stood at - 0.1% in October , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , compared with - 0.3% in September .
The current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect mainly movements in global commodity prices over the last year .
In the coming months , annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again , also relating to base effects .
Thereafter , over the policy-relevant horizon , inflation is expected to remain positive , with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector declined further in September , to 1.8% and - 0.3% respectively .
The annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector turned slightly negative in September , with annual loan growth to both non-financial corporations and households declining further and being negative .
At the same time , the monthly flows of loans to households remained positive and even increased , while those of loans to non-financial corporations were negative .
In this respect , it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically only picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity .
Looking ahead , and taking into account the improved conditions in financial markets , not all liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past .
Moreover , high public deficits and debts may complicate the task of the single monetary policy to maintain price stability .
The Governing Council therefore calls upon governments to communicate and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions , with a strong focus on expenditure reforms .
This is an area in which quick and decisive progress is indispensable for the countries concerned and for the euro area as a whole .

The NCBs also contribute to the work of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) through their participation in the various Eurosystem / ESCB Committees ( see also separate slide « Eurosystem / ESCB Committees ") .
Such non-Eurosystem functions vary according to countries and mainly consist of various types of financial and administrative services to the governments of the respective countries .
Most NCBs for example are involved in the supervision of financial institutions in their respective countries and some NCBs run their own printing works for the production of banknotes .
Overall , the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative .
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 29 September 2009 on a proposal for a Council Regulation on the introduction of the euro ( codified version ) ( CON / 2009/76 ) ( 2009 / C 246/01 ) Introduction and legal basis On 15 July 2009 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a Council Regulation on the introduction of the euro ( codified version ) ( 1 ) ( hereinafter the « proposed regulation ') .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 123 ( 4 ) , third sentence , of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
The ECB generally welcomes codification of the acquis communautaire , and in particular in the field of economic and monetary union , which contributes to a clear , effective and transparent legal framework .
A specific drafting proposal is set out in the Annex accompanied by explanatory text to this effect .

The ECB closely monitors advances in printing and reproduction technologies , as well as the number of counterfeits seized .
The counterfeits are analysed by the central banks of the euro area and the ECB 's Counterfeit Analysis Centre , which coordinates technical and statistical information on counterfeits .
The information stored in the centre 's database is shared with national police forces and other bodies involved in combating counterfeiting .
Anti-counterfeiting technologies , supported by the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group ( CBCDG ) of 10 of the world 's major banknote issuing authorities , deter digital counterfeiting and , by preventing the production of counterfeit banknotes , reduce the losses to individuals and business that might receive them .
( iv ) supervised credit institutions referred to in Article 3 ( a )( 1 ) , which are not eligible counterparties for Eurosystem monetary policy operations and / or do not have access to the marginal lending facility .
Intraday credit provided in accordance with Article 3 ( f ) shall be free of interest .
There shall be no interest payable on any compensation payment .
The European Central Bank and the national central banks together constitute the Eurosystem , the central banking system of the euro area .
At today 's meeting , which was held in Brussels , the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.00% , 3.00% and 1.00% respectively .

The Governing Council discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation , recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments .
In this context , the Governing Council stressed the crucial importance of keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its objective of price stability .
At the same time , the Governing Council recognised that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time .
With the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared .
While the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term , the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation .
Against this background , the Governing Council stressed that it remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting and called upon all parties concerned to meet their responsibilities in the face of the current exceptional challenges .
Accordingly , the Governing Council confirmed its determination to secure price stability in the medium term and that it will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead .
As the world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects of the intensified and prolonged financial market turmoil , the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening , with dampened domestic demand and tighter financing conditions .
The fall in oil prices from their peak in July and ongoing growth in emerging market economies might support a gradual recovery in the course of 2009 .
In the view of the Governing Council , the economic outlook is subject to increased downside risks , mainly stemming from a scenario of ongoing financial market tensions affecting the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen .
Other downside risks relate to the possibility of renewed increases in highly volatile energy and food prices , disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures .
With regard to price developments , annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn , standing at 3.6% in September according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , after 3.8% in August .
Broad-based second-round effects stemming from the impact of past energy and food price increases on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided .
The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention and once again expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices .
The Governing Council therefore calls for these schemes to be abolished .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the latest monetary data refer to the end of August and thus do not yet embody the impact of the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil .
Further data will be carefully evaluated in order to assess this impact .
As a general observation , previous episodes suggest that financial market tensions can have a relatively limited impact on monetary developments , but they have also been associated with large portfolio shifts and thus have exerted significant influence on monetary data .
First , there has been a substitution from longer-term maturity assets into instruments covered by M3 , which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk .
As a consequence , the annual growth rate of M3 probably overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion .
Second , there have been substitution effects within M3 .
To sum up , the Governing Council discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation , recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments .
In this context , the Governing Council stressed how crucial it is for monetary policy to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its objective of price stability .
The cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time and , when taking into account the weakening of demand , that upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared .
It is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting .
All parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities .
Accordingly , the Governing Council confirms its determination to secure price stability in the medium term and emphasises that it will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead .
Regarding fiscal policy , in the current situation of continuing economic uncertainty , it is essential that governments abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and ensure the sustainability of public finances .
Maintaining sound public finances will enable governments to let automatic stabilisers operate freely and thus contribute to smoothing the economic cycle and to supporting private sector confidence .
Turning to structural policies , measures that foster competition and flexibility and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances .
While moderate unit labour cost growth is crucial in all euro area countries , it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise .
The Governing Council has decided to increase the allotment amount for each of the longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted in the year 2005 from EUR 25 billion to EUR 30 billion .
The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be increased by 25 basis points to 4.00% , starting from the operation to be settled on 13 June 2007 .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 5.00% , with effect from 13 June 2007 .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be increased by 25 basis points to 3.00% , with effect from 13 June 2007 .
